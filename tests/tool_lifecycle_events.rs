//! Prove that a tool action leaves durable lifecycle records in the trace journal.
//!
//! Four invariants, checked end-to-end: the real binary drives a turn that performs
//! more than one tool action against the deterministic fake provider, and the trace
//! is then read back out of the store. What the journal must show is that
//!
//! 1. one durable call id ties every record of one tool action together,
//! 2. each tool action leaves exactly one terminal record, ordered after the record
//!    that started it,
//! 3. a failing action is closed by a failure record, not a bare success, and
//! 4. an action whose completion the runtime could not observe stays unknown: it is
//!    never recorded as either success or failure.
