# COMPATIBILITY

## 1. Purpose

`rupi` is heavily inspired by Pi and should support a meaningful subset of the Pi ecosystem.

Compatibility must be:

- explicit;
- versioned;
- testable;
- documented by surface;
- honest about unsupported behavior.

Do not use a blanket claim such as "fully Pi-compatible."

## 2. Compatibility philosophy

The project targets **behavioral compatibility**, not source-level implementation equivalence.

A Pi artifact is considered compatible when users can reasonably reuse it without rewriting its conceptual behavior.

Compatibility priorities are driven by ecosystem value and implementation cost.

## 3. Compatibility levels

Use the following status vocabulary:

- `Supported` — expected to work and covered by tests.
- `Partial` — useful subset works; limitations are documented.
- `Experimental` — available but unstable or incomplete.
- `Unsupported` — intentionally not supported.
- `Unknown` — not yet evaluated.

## 4. Initial target matrix

| Surface | Initial target |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` skills | Supported |
| Coding-agent system prompt | Partial (native baseline; not byte-compatible) |
| Prompt templates | Supported |
| Package discovery | Supported |
| Package installation | Partial |
| Package manifests | Supported |
| Session import | Partial |
| Session export | Partial |
| Themes | Partial |
| Extension `registerTool` | Supported (selected host subset) |
| Extension `registerCommand` | Supported (selected host subset) |
| Extension lifecycle events | Partial (selected events) |
| Extension context hooks | Partial (message transformation subset) |
| Complex custom TUI | Experimental |
| Arbitrary Pi internal imports | Unsupported |
| Undocumented Pi internals | Unsupported |

## 5. Skills

Skills are a high-priority compatibility target.

Requirements:

- preserve standard `SKILL.md` structure;
- support package-local and project-local discovery where practical;
- retain relative resource references;
- preserve user-visible semantics;
- test representative real-world skills.

Skills should not require the Node compatibility host unless they explicitly depend on executable TypeScript/JavaScript behavior.

### 5.1 Implemented

`rupi skills [--project]` scans, in order: `$HOME/.pi/agent/skills`,
`$HOME/.agents/skills`, then `<ancestor>/.pi/skills` and `<ancestor>/.agents/skills` from
the working directory up to the git root. Within a location, a directory containing
`SKILL.md` is a skill; a root `*.md` file is a skill in the `.pi` family and is ignored
in the shared `.agents` family, where only files inside a grouping directory count. The
frontmatter subset read is `name` (required), `description` (required — a skill that
cannot say what it does is never offered), `license`, `compatibility`, `allowed-tools`,
`disable-model-invocation`, including quoted scalars and `|`/`>` block scalars. Project
locations are read only with `--project`. Walks are depth-bounded, and symlinks are
followed — linking in a skill kept elsewhere is the normal way to share one, and trust was
already decided about the directory holding the link — with the depth bound stopping a
link that walks a scan back on itself and saying so.

A session offers its skills the way Pi does. `rupi run` and `rupi interactive` scan
the global locations at session open and put the result in front of every request as the
system message: Pi's skill-control block — the three instruction sentences, then one
`<skill>` entry per visible skill with its `name`, `description`, and `location` (the
file the read tool should be given), XML-escaped as the Agent Skills standard spells it.
A `disable-model-invocation` skill is absent from the block down to its name; asking for
it by name (`rupi skills --show <name>`, which prints the body with the frontmatter
removed) is the explicit invocation that flag reserves for the user.
`rupi skills --control-prompt` prints exactly what a session would send, empty stdout
when there is nothing to offer — and only global locations reach a session, because the
workspace's own skill files need a trust decision `run` does not have. Discovery commands
accept `--trust-store <dir>` to consult durable canonical project scopes; an explicit
`--project` is a one-shot grant for an unknown scope, but a recorded denial still wins.

Package-local skills from discovered packages and `--skill <path>` CLI options are supported. The `skills` array in settings is deferred.

`rupi run` and `rupi interactive` always include a concise native coding-agent prompt with
the current workspace, tool-use guidance, and verification expectations. Discovered skill
instructions are appended to that baseline. This provides the expected coding-agent
behavior when no skills are installed; it does not claim byte-for-byte parity with Pi's
versioned default prompt.

## 6. Prompt templates

Prompt templates should preserve:

- naming;
- discovery;
- invocation;
- expected variable behavior where documented.

Prompt compatibility should remain independent from the runtime provider implementation.

### 6.1 Implemented

`rupi prompts [--project]` scans, in order, `$HOME/.pi/agent/prompts/*.md` then
`<ancestor>/.pi/prompts/*.md` from the working directory up to the git root — the
locations Pi documents, in the order it reads them, so first-found-wins naming is
reproducible. Discovery is non-recursive and matches `*.md`, which is why a
subdirectory, a `.txt`, and a dotfile are skipped without a word: Pi documents those
rules and skips them silently, so a warning on every run would only train the user to
ignore warnings. A template's name is its filename without the extension; Pi imposes no
spelling rule on one, so neither does this. Frontmatter is optional in full: the
`description` is read when declared, otherwise Pi takes the first non-empty body line and
this says so in the listing rather than presenting an unauthored line as a summary. The
body is kept with only its surrounding blank lines removed — line breaks inside a template
are part of the prompt.

`rupi prompt [--project] <name> [arguments…]` performs Pi's substitution and writes the
prompt to stdout and nothing else: `$1`…`$n`, `$@` and `$ARGUMENTS`, `${1:-default}`,
`${@:-default}`, `${ARGUMENTS:-default}`, `${@:N}`, `${@:N:L}`. Since `$1` is a
placeholder, so is every digit after a `$`; a placeholder that matches none of the grammar
is left in the output exactly as written rather than deleted or rejected. Options are read
before the name, so `rupi prompt lint --strict` passes `--strict` to the template.

`rupi interactive` invokes a loaded template as `/name [arguments…]`: the typed string
is split by Pi's editor rule (`parseCommandArgs`) — bash-style quotes whose quirks are
reproduced, not smoothed — and the expansion is sent as the turn.

Package `prompts/` directories, `pi.prompts` entries, `--prompt-template` paths,
and `--no-prompt-templates` are supported. The `prompts` array in settings is deferred.

## 7. Packages

Support Pi-style package discovery and installation as early as practical. Discovery and
surface diagnostics are supported, and `rupi packages install <local-directory>` now copies
an explicit local package into the global or `--project` package root without running
scripts. npm/git/HTTP sources, dependency installation, update/remove settings, and
automatic extension discovery remain deferred; extension execution is `Partial` through
the explicitly activated Node host described below.

Goals:

- recognize compatible package manifests;
- install an explicit local package directory without following symlinks or running scripts;
- expose contained skills/prompts/extensions;
- report unsupported package surfaces clearly;
- leave remote source resolution and dependency installation explicit as unsupported until
  their subprocess/network/trust contract is implemented.

A package should not be considered incompatible merely because one optional feature is unsupported.

Prefer per-surface diagnostics.

Example:

```text
Package compatibility

✓ skills
✓ prompts
✓ registerTool
△ custom UI
✗ internal Pi module import
```

### 7.1 Implemented

`rupi packages [--project]` scans, in order: `$HOME/.pi/agent/packages`,
`$HOME/.pi/packages`, then `<ancestor>/.pi/packages` from the working directory up
to the git root. `--trust-store <dir>` can resolve the project scope before those
locations are read. Discovery is non-recursive at each package root: every child
directory holding a `package.json` is a package candidate. A package declares its
identity (`name`, `version`, `description`) and contained surfaces (`pi.skills`,
`pi.prompts`, `extensions`).

When a package declares no explicit skill or prompt paths, standard conventions apply:
`<package>/skills/` or `<package>/SKILL.md` is exposed for skills, and `<package>/prompts/`
for prompt templates. Project package locations are read only when the project is trusted
(`--project`), preserving the trust boundary. Manifest surface paths must be relative and
contained within the package; absolute, parent-traversing, or outward-symlink paths are
reported and not activated. Duplicate package names resolve to the first package found.
Deferred or unsupported surfaces produce per-surface diagnostics without rejecting the
package. Extension entry points are marked partial until a trusted caller explicitly
constructs the Node host; project-local files are never executed implicitly.

`rupi packages --show <name>` displays detailed surface status and contained locations.

## 8. TypeScript extensions

Selected Pi TypeScript extensions run through the optional `rupi-extension` host.
The host is an explicit, trusted boundary: constructing it performs no process I/O, an
empty module list never launches Node, and only `start`/dispatch of configured modules
loads code. The host accepts Pi's default factory shape and Node's type-only imports for
`.ts` fixtures. TypeScript fixtures require Node 22.6+ (`--experimental-strip-types`);
CI pins Node 22.x. Dependency installation and arbitrary package resolution remain out of
scope.

Architecture:

```text
rupi / rupi-compat caller
  |
rupi-extension (typed JSON-lines RPC + Tool wrapper)
  |
Node host bootstrap
  |
Pi-style TypeScript extension
```

Implemented selected APIs:

1. `pi.registerTool({ name, label, description, parameters, execute })`, with conservative
   mutating defaults and `ToolExecutionState::Unknown` when completion is uncertain;
2. `pi.registerCommand(name, { description, handler })`;
3. `pi.on` for `session_start`, `session_shutdown`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`, `tool_call`,
   `tool_result`, and `context`;
4. `ctx.ui.notify`, `setStatus`, and `setWidget`, returned as typed UI events;
5. context-hook message replacement and structured tool/command results.

The host keeps extension exceptions as typed boundary errors and leaves the process alive
for later dispatch where possible. Process/protocol loss is distinct and never becomes an
observed successful core operation. `tests/compat/extensions/` and
`tests/extension_host.rs` cover registration, lifecycle/context/UI dispatch, lazy startup,
and failure isolation. Full custom TUI components, shortcuts/flags, provider registration,
state persistence, and UI prompts remain unsupported or deferred.

## 9. Native extensions

A Rust/WASM-native extension system may be added later.

It must not replace the TypeScript compatibility path prematurely.

Goals:

- native low-overhead extensions;
- strong typed API;
- optional sandboxing;
- no requirement that Pi packages migrate.

## 10. Sessions

Session compatibility is expected to be partial initially.

Preferred architecture:

- maintain a stronger internal session/event model;
- provide Pi import/export adapters;
- preserve compatible message semantics;
- preserve model/tool metadata when representable;
- warn when `rupi`-specific provenance cannot round-trip.

Do not weaken the internal event model merely to force exact storage-format equivalence.

### 10.1 Importing a Pi session

`rupi import-pi <session.jsonl>` reads one Pi session file and files it as a rupi
session. It is a reader and a writer, never an executor: a tool call in Pi's file records
work Pi already did, and `rupi` will not do it again.

The path may also be a directory: every `*.jsonl` directly inside it is imported, in name
order, each as its own session. That is also the boundary of what a batch carries — lineage
Pi records *across* files (a fork written as a second file pointing at the first) is not
reconstructed, because no rupi session state has that shape. One file's failure is one
report line; the sessions beside it still land, and the exit says the batch was partial.

Mapped, at the fidelity the file supports:

| Pi | `rupi` |
| --- | --- |
| `message` (role `user`) | `user_input`, with non-text blocks counted as attachments; the imported Pi role is explicit source evidence |
| `message` (role `assistant`) | one request span: `reasoning_delta`, `assistant_delta`, `tool_requested`, `model_request_completed` carrying Pi's usage and stop reason |
| `message` (role `toolResult`) | `tool_completed`, output filed past the store's inline threshold, under the durable redaction policy |
| `model_change`, `thinking_level_change` | info `diagnostic`; opening a model epoch would claim capabilities Pi never recorded |
| entry tree (`id` / `parentId`) | the path from the newest-written entry to the root; everything else is counted per type and named |
| header line | session id `pi-<pi id>`, `imported_from: "pi"`, Pi's `cwd`, the first readable entry timestamp |

One plan writes two durable records. The trace journal holds the events above. The session
log holds the conversation as message records, each bound to the event that introduced it: a
Pi user entry to its `user_input`, an imported assistant reply — its prose and its calls,
never its reasoning — to the first `assistant_delta`, and a tool result to its terminal tool
event. Native runtime replies bind to the terminal `model_request_completed` instead, so
assistant prose and tool calls are recovered as one atomic message transaction. That binding
is what makes an imported session resumable rather than merely readable, and the distinction
stays inside the store so `load_session` needs no idea that Pi was involved. Pi records no turn ids, so the import anchors one turn per user entry (`turn-<entry
id>`); it is derived from the file, so re-importing produces the same turns.

Deliberately not carried, each reported by kind with its reason:

* `compaction` — the boundary is kept as a diagnostic; re-importing the summary text would
  put the conversation in twice;
* `label`, `custom`, `custom_message` — UI- or extension-owned content with no `rupi`
  event, which importing as prose would misattribute to the user or the model;
* `cost` — `rupi` has no billing-cost field. Pi's input, cache-read, and cache-write
  counts are preserved in `model_request_completed`; new imports normalize
  `input_tokens` to the logical prompt count and retain uncached input separately;
* an image whose Pi entry carried no bytes — counted as an attachment and reported. An image
  that did carry bytes is kept inline in the session's messages, where `rupi` keeps one;
* reasoning on a request that stored none receives **no** provenance rather than a plausible one.

Timestamps are parsed without a date library. `Z` and `±HH:MM` are honoured; a zone-less
stamp is read as UTC. A consistently wrong reading beats discarding the stamp: entries in
one file keep their relative order either way, and Pi writes `Z` in practice.

Silence is only for what Pi deliberately ignores. Everything else — a damaged line, an
unrecognised entry type, an entry off the active path — is reported with the path and the
reason, and a missing header, duplicate id, dangling parent, or cycle is an error rather
than something to paper over.

### 10.2 Exporting a Pi session

`rupi export <session-id> [--out <path>]` writes one `rupi` session back out in Pi's JSONL shape.
The emitted shape is derived from what `rupi import-pi` accepts:

- A version 3 header (`type: "session"`, `id`, `cwd`, `timestamp`);
- `UserInput` events exported as Pi user message entries and linked sequentially with `parentId`;
- Assistant reply text and tool calls folded from streamed deltas into Pi message blocks.

Legacy `UserMessage` events do not prove human authorship, so their text is omitted and named
as ambiguous on stderr rather than exported as user-authored content. Runtime-control events are
also reported as non-message trace details, not rewritten as Pi user turns.

Anything the canonical trace holds that Pi's shape cannot carry is explicitly surfaced on
stderr as a dropped item rather than silently discarded or falsified.

### 10.3 Non-round-trippable metadata

See [`docs/SESSION_COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/SESSION_COMPATIBILITY.md) for the complete bidirectional
fidelity matrix and design invariants.

Summary of metadata that cannot round-trip between Pi and `rupi`:

1. **Reasoning provenance**: `rupi` models 4 distinct provenance tiers (`Native`, `ProviderSummary`,
   `Declared`, `Reconstructed`). Pi has untyped `thinking` blocks with no
   provenance concept. Export reports dropped provenance on stderr; import never invents native
   provenance for unlabelled foreign thinking.
2. **Multi-branch DAGs vs linear turns**: Pi records branching trees (`id`/`parentId`). `rupi`
   imports only the active path from the newest-written entry to root; off-path forks are dropped
   and reported by type on stderr.
3. **Model epochs & failovers**: `rupi` tracks typed model epochs (`ModelEpochStarted`) and
   reasons for failover. Pi stores only string `model` fields per assistant message.
4. **Tool lifecycle & safety invariants**: `rupi` tracks 5 execution states (`Requested`, `Started`,
   `Completed`, `Failed`, `Unknown`) and `read_only` safety flags in `trace.jsonl`. Pi records only
   coarse messages.
5. **Payload externalization & blob stores**: Payloads exceeding 8 KiB reside in `blobs/sha256/...`
   in `rupi`. Pi has no session blob store; export emits the inline preview.
6. **Context reductions & redactions**: `ContextReduced` token/byte statistics and durable redaction
   counts exist only in `rupi` canonical traces.
7. **Diagnostics & checkpoints**: Operational events (`Diagnostic`, `Checkpoint`, `SessionEnded`)
   have no counterpart in Pi message logs and stay in `rupi` traces.
8. **Compaction summaries**: Pi compaction summaries are marked as diagnostic boundaries on import,
   preventing duplicate turn replay.
9. **UI / Extension entries**: Pi `label`, `custom`, and `custom_message` records are dropped on
   import with explicit stderr warnings.
10. **Provider billing metadata**: Pi's `cost` is omitted because `rupi` records token quantities,
    not billing amounts. Its input, cache-read, and cache-write counts are preserved on import.

## 11. Themes and UI

Basic theme semantics may be supported.

Complex Pi custom UI behavior should be best-effort because:

- the TUI implementation differs;
- `rupi` adds new provenance and runtime states;
- exact widget-level parity may be costly.

Compatibility should focus first on preserving intent rather than exact rendering.

## 12. Provider compatibility

Provider compatibility is separate from Pi package compatibility.

The runtime should support:

- local OpenAI-compatible endpoints;
- remote OpenAI-compatible endpoints;
- provider-specific adapters where needed.

Provider normalization should preserve:

- model capability metadata;
- tool calls;
- exposed reasoning and its explicit provenance;
- stream completion;
- typed failures.

Generic endpoint constructors declare no reasoning exposure by default. Reasoning-shaped fields
are discarded from the semantic stream until their provenance is explicitly declared; field names
alone do not establish native exposure. `preserve_reasoning` is valid only for explicitly native
endpoints and remains opt-in. Completed assistant history persists exposed reasoning and provenance
even when the endpoint elects not to replay it. Provider adapters and the runtime collector enforce
aggregate response and raw SSE-frame bounds so malformed streams cannot grow unbounded.

## 13. MCP compatibility

MCP version handling should remain isolated in the MCP adapter. Stdio and the bounded
Streamable HTTP transport are supported; HTTP responses are JSON or matching-response SSE,
with session headers and bounded bodies. One-shot HTTP calls run behind a cancellation-aware
local relay with bounded resolution and fail-closed interruption; long-lived server push
remains deferred.

Requirements:

- protocol negotiation where practical;
- graceful support for selected older protocol versions;
- no assumption that every server supports the latest optional extensions;
- stable internal tool/resource normalization;
- dynamically discovered manager tools pass a provider-safe name and bounded schema/metadata
  admission layer before model exposure. Unsafe or over-budget catalogs fail closed; this is a
  deliberate robustness boundary, not a promise to expose arbitrary server metadata verbatim.

`rkb-rs` is integrated through the independent `rupi-rkb` adapter. The adapter
recognizes the verified `rkb mcp` stdio contract, marks its retrieval tools read-only,
keeps activation lazy, parses citation-bearing `get_agent_context` responses, and
rehydrates compact references through exact-id `search_chunks` queries. RKB source URL,
document, page, record id, citation, and provenance are retained in the generic external
context reference and durable retrieval event. No direct dependency on the external
`rkb-rs` crate is introduced.

The server-side worker boundary is implemented separately in `rupi-mcp::worker`. It
supports the five coarse `agent.*` operations and `session://` resource projections over
stdio JSON-RPC. An embedding application must explicitly provide a trusted headless
`WorkerEngine`; the adapter never discovers project code or starts a provider by itself.
Run handles are asynchronous and cancellable, waits are capped, summaries are kept
separate from coarse trace projections, and unavailable diff/artifact data is reported
explicitly. Read-only replay/history analysis is provided by `rupi-replay`; worker-side
execution of historical branches and streamable HTTP worker transport remain deferred.

`rupi replay <trace-or-session.jsonl>` provides deterministic tools/reasoning/timing filters,
inclusive historical cutoffs, model-visible context snapshots, dry branch plans, structural
continuation comparison, timelines, provenance summaries, and redacted trace export. It does
not launch a provider or execute a recorded tool.

## 14. Compatibility tests

Maintain fixtures for:

```text
tests/compat/
  skills/
  prompts/
  packages/
  sessions/
  extensions/
```

Tests should cover both:

- synthetic minimal fixtures;
- representative real-world public packages.

## 15. Compatibility command

Inspects an artifact or package candidate against Pi compatibility targets:

```bash
rupi compat [options] <path-or-package>
```

Options:
- `--project`: include project package locations when resolving package names;
- `--json`: emit machine-readable JSON report.

Example output:

```text
Compatibility target: Pi 0.50.x+
Target: with-extension (package)

✓ package manifest (with-extension@1.0.0)
✓ skill discovery (1 skill(s) found)
✓ prompt templates (1 prompt template(s) found)
✓ tool registration (registerTool API detected)
✓ command registration (registerCommand API detected)
△ context hook (context lifecycle hook detected)
✗ unsupported internal import (internal Pi module import detected)
△ extensions (selected TypeScript APIs available; explicit host activation required)
```

## 16. Version policy

`rupi` should declare which Pi behavior/version family it targets.

Compatibility changes should be documented in release notes.

When upstream Pi changes behavior:

1. detect via fixtures;
2. classify impact;
3. update compatibility implementation or document divergence;
4. avoid silent semantic drift.

## 17. Deliberate divergences

`rupi` may intentionally diverge where its runtime architecture requires stronger semantics.

Expected divergences include:

- richer event provenance;
- explicit model epochs;
- built-in context lifecycle;
- built-in failover;
- rehydratable external context;
- stricter tool transaction state;
- optional cooperative turn-time limits with runtime-owned guidance and an explicit
  exhausted status; native Pi control parity is not claimed;
- optional initial progress boundary for explicitly selected implementation turns;
  native Pi control parity is not claimed;
- optional first-request output ceiling within that initial boundary; owned runtime and
  provider-wire fixtures establish budgeting behavior, not acceptance or latency benefit;
  native Pi selection remains null;
- optional first-request string argument limits for mutating tools, advertised through
  request-local schemas and enforced before dispatch. Owned Unicode/schema/renewal/wire
  fixtures cover this Rupi-specific contract; acceptance benefit and Pi parity are unproved;
- optional bounded same-model completion review; this is runtime guidance rather than
  certification that the user's task is correct, and native Pi parity is not claimed;
- optional caller-delegated completion observations through an explicit run mailbox;
  public feedback may permit bounded same-model repair, and unavailable observations stop
  without replay. Owned protocol/runtime/host fixtures cover this Rupi-specific behavior;
  native Pi control parity and acceptance benefit are not claimed;
- caller public-check snapshots use a short isolated root for Windows process startup;
  owned long-path/missing-deliverable/repair fixtures preserve observation classification;
- potentially different internal session storage.

These divergences should not unnecessarily break ecosystem-level reuse.

## 18. Compatibility principle

> Preserve user-facing ecosystem value before internal parity.

If supporting an undocumented internal behavior would significantly complicate the runtime, prefer a documented incompatibility over architectural debt.
