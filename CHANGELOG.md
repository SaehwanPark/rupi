## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added an optional caller observation when timed completion review begins, so bounded
  public feedback can reach the active model before its final answer. Review and final
  checking share an allowance; passes do not replace review or a fresh final check.
  Unavailable observations, cancellation and uncertain-effect barriers retain their stops.

- Added optional first-request thinking selection within initial progress, renewed each
  turn and inherited normally afterward. The endpoint owns disable encoding; requested
  Off is not a claim about observed hidden reasoning or guaranteed backend enforcement.

- Added optional initial mutating-tool string argument bounds, with request-local schema
  constraints and pre-dispatch rejection of oversized completed calls. Unicode counting,
  first-request capture and fresh-turn renewal are verified; later calls remain available.

- Added an optional initial progress output ceiling for the first ordinary request only,
  with smaller-change guidance, endpoint/context clamping and renewal each turn. Later
  requests retain the endpoint ceiling. The Case10 harness can select this independently;
  acceptance, latency and Pi control parity remain unproved.

- Added explicit bounded Case10 benchmark mutation-budget selection, preserving runtime
  defaults and total/request/time limits. Owned fixtures show mutation headroom can permit
  later delivery/checking; acceptance improvement and native Pi control parity remain unproved.

- Added optional bounded caller completion observations and a run-only private mailbox.
  Failed public feedback can guide same-model repair; unavailable observations stop without
  replay or failover. Core/CLI execute no checks; the caller isolates verification effects.
  The Case10 benchmark can check copied public files during a turn while keeping independent
  acceptance after closure. This does not certify correctness or claim Pi control parity.

- Added an optional initial progress boundary for authorized implementation turns with
  supplied context, reusing existing tool eligibility, approval and effect-safety checks.
- Added an opt-in bounded completion review so the active model can check requested
  deliverables and continue permitted work within existing turn budgets and safety barriers.
  An optional remaining-time reserve triggers the same one-shot review during ongoing work.
  The preceding model/tool cycle's observed duration anticipates spending that reserve.
- Added an optional cooperative turn-time budget with runtime-owned remaining-time
  guidance and an explicit exhausted status, preserving uncertain-mutation recovery.
- Added an opt-in model progress boundary for bounded implementation turns. It can
  narrow the next request to configured mutating tools after repeated inspection-only
  tool requests while preserving normal tool lifecycle and `Unknown` semantics.

### Fixed

- Keep Case10 public-check snapshots under a short isolated scratch root on Windows,
  preserving run-local mailboxes and artifacts. Long working directories can prevent
  child startup; known missing deliverables now reach failed feedback through the caller.
- Preserve child exit diagnostics in the CLI mailbox fixture and allow CI scheduling
  headroom without changing production turn deadlines or repair assertions.

- Resume sessions after an output-limit response containing partial text and unexecuted
  tool calls, preserving canonical evidence without projecting or replaying the failed response.
- Preserve useful missed-edit location hints for long first lines without applying approximate
  replacements or changing interrupted-mutation reconciliation.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-20

This release makes the first installation and first-project path usable without requiring
Rust when a supported prebuilt archive is available.

### Added

- Added checksum-verified `install.sh` for Linux/macOS and `install.ps1` for Windows.
- Added release archives for Linux x86_64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon, and Windows x86_64,
  plus a tag-driven GitHub Actions publication workflow.
- Added the Test Ledger live example and its independent subprocess acceptance walkthrough.

### Documentation

- Updated the README and mdBook installation guide with installer, source-build, and
  checksum/recovery instructions.
- Added the Test Ledger first-task walkthrough covering safe inspection, bounded changes,
  independent tests, trace, and replay.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-20

`rupi` is the new project identity. This release clarifies that the runtime is an
independent implementation with selected Pi compatibility, not a Pi rewrite or Rust port.

### Changed

- Renamed the GitHub repository, binary, workspace crates, state/config examples,
  environment variables, CI commands, and public URLs from the former project identity to
  `rupi`.
- Updated the beginner guide, examples, and screenshots for the real llama.cpp endpoint
  at `127.0.0.1:8000` serving `qwen3.8-flash-next`; the local smoke evidence covers provider,
  one-shot run, trace, and replay.
- Curated resolved audit and proposal material into explicit historical archives.
- Made `import-pi` the documented session-import command while retaining `import` as a
  compatibility alias.
- Removed one redundant CLI stdout assertion after reviewing the suite; boundary, failure,
  provenance, compatibility, and recovery coverage remains intact.

### Fixed

- Preserved the request-line separator in the cancellable HTTP relay so strict local
  llama.cpp servers receive a valid `HTTP/1.1` request.

### Migration

Update scripts and local configuration to call `rupi` and use `.rupi-state`. Upstream Pi
paths such as `.pi/skills` and Pi JSONL session files remain unchanged for compatibility.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-19

`v0.2.0` packages the audited mainline after the Round 9 sign-off. The audit cycle
closed with no remaining P0 or P1 findings; the release focuses on crash recovery,
bounded transports, conservative tool state, and clearer public documentation.

### Added

- Durable audit evidence for the completed Round 9 review.
- Conservative recovery across session leases, legacy-store migration, checkpoint
  projections, and model-visible message reconstruction.
- Explicit replay and resume boundaries for externalized payloads and uncertain tool
  calls, preserving `Unknown` rather than guessing that a mutating operation failed or
  succeeded.
- Bounded and cancellable provider/MCP relay behavior, including bounded DNS worker
  capacity and fail-closed handling for interrupted requests.

### Fixed

- Closed interrupted tool-failure transactions so the projection WAL cannot remain open
  after a decoded but unexecuted call.
- Preserved exact tool-request identities and parentage through failed provider streams
  and immediate session restore.
- Hardened filesystem, redaction, output-bound, cancellation, and Windows portability
  paths covered by the audit rounds.

### Documentation

- Updated the workspace and lockfile to version `0.2.0`.
- Refreshed the README, mdBook guides, CLI examples, compatibility notes, and release
  documentation for the current command and configuration surfaces.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

#### Core Runtime & Presentation
- **Interactive TUI (`rupi interactive`)**: High-performance terminal user interface with a terminal-native semantic renderer and `crossterm`, featuring a multi-line editing buffer, ANSI-clean line rendering, live stream display, and real-time statusline.
- **One-Shot Runner (`rupi run`)**: Headless command-line runner with strict stream separation (assistant answer on `stdout`; provenance, tool lifecycle, and diagnostics on `stderr`).
- **Workspace Confinement**: Strict realpath confinement to `--cwd` for built-in file operations (`read`, `write`, `edit`). Mutating operations require explicit `auto_approve_mutating` configuration.
- **Durable Event Store**: Append-only event logging (`trace.jsonl`), session index, and blob storage under `.rupi-state`.
- **Deterministic Replay (`rupi replay`)**: Replay recorded sessions identically to live runs without network calls or mutating side-effects.
- **Trace Inspection (`rupi trace`)**: Chronological structured event log viewer.

#### Honest Reasoning Provenance
- Explicit typed labels for reasoning streams:
  - `[native reasoning]`: authentic model thinking tokens.
  - `[provider summary]`: provider-generated summaries of hidden reasoning.
  - `[declared]`: explicitly declared rationale.
  - `[reconstructed]`: post-hoc recovered explanation.
- Invariant enforced: hidden chain-of-thought is never falsely claimed as recovered.

#### Model Providers & Failover
- Unified provider abstraction supporting OpenAI-compatible local endpoints (including llama.cpp)
  and cloud endpoints.
- Resilient primary/backup failover with pre-flight capability matching (tools, modalities, context limits) and lazy adapter initialization.

#### Pi Ecosystem Compatibility
- **Skills (`rupi skills`)**: Behavioral-compatible discovery for user (`~/.pi/agent/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`) and project-level skills (`.pi/skills`, `.agents/skills`) guarded by explicit `--project` trust checks.
- **Prompt Templates (`rupi prompts`, `rupi prompt`)**: Template discovery and positional argument expansion (`$1`, `$@`, `${1:-default}`).
- **Packages (`rupi packages`)**: Manifest discovery and local package installation.
- **Session Migration (`rupi import`, `rupi export`)**: Loss-diagnostic bidirectional migration between `rupi` store and Pi JSONL formats.
- **Trust Store (`rupi trust`)**: Per-project allow/deny trust record management.
- **Compatibility Diagnostics (`rupi compat`)**: Compatibility auditing for external packages and artifacts.

#### Integrations & Latency
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Lazy stdio client architecture initializing servers on demand.
- **Verified v0.1.0 latency evidence**: Warm startup was measured at 0.35 ms, cold startup at 0.80 ms, and keystroke latency below 2 ms on the release host; current budgets and evidence commands are documented in the v0.2.0 guide.

#### Documentation & Public Site
- Comprehensive public documentation deployed via mdBook on GitHub Pages.
- Clean reorganization of internal/historical slices into `docs/archive/`.
- Modern, concise README with representative screenshots.
