# Case 01: Task Ledger — Pi comparison slice

Status: in progress
Branch: `bench/case01-rupi-over-pi`
Target model: local llama.cpp `qwen3.8-flash-next` (UD-IQ4_XS)

## Scope and gate

This slice evaluates and improves only `01-task-ledger`. It compares the current
`rupi` build with Pi 0.86.1 using `bench/compare-pi-rupi.ps1`, clean isolated
workspaces, the same model endpoint, the same two-turn limit, and the unchanged
fresh-process acceptance oracle. Keep the generated workspaces and raw traces in
ignored `.benchmark/` storage.

The case is resolved only when the independent acceptance oracle exits zero.
The slice is a `rupi` win if it resolves in fewer turns than Pi, or if both resolve
in the same turn and `rupi` uses fewer measured inference-work tokens and no more
agent wall time. A single local-model run is empirical evidence for this case,
not a general claim about all models or environments.

## Prior evidence

The original matched run, `bench-20260920-01-05`, recorded two unsuccessful
turns for each client on this case. `rupi` and Pi both ended with oracle exit code
1; the raw inputs, outputs, traces, snapshots, and verification logs remain under
the local ignored benchmark run directory. The broader original benchmark also
recorded 0/10 resolved cases for each client. Those results predate the current
runtime and must be treated as historical baseline only.

## Current-run status

Pending. Rebuild the merged `main` runtime, run the matched Case 01 comparison,
inspect per-turn outputs and oracle results, and identify one concrete `rupi`
runtime cause before changing code. Record the run ID, exact command, outcome,
token and wall measurements, checks, review, and residual limitations below as
work proceeds.
