# Case 10 comparison ledger: receipt ledger

This ledger records the matched `10-receipt-ledger` run with local `qwen3.8-flash-next` and
Pi 0.86.1. The case tests the capstone pipeline's same-transaction, append-only SHA-256 audit
chain.

## Matched baseline

Run: `bench-20260929-case10-pi0861-low-matched4-600s`.

The run summary recorded `pi_version: 0.86.1`. Settings were low reasoning, four turns, eight
requests per turn, 600-second outer timeouts, and project-test/help recovery feedback. Rupi
used a 570-second provider deadline. Work tokens are inference input plus output.

| Rupi turn | Elapsed | Input / output | Work tokens | Requests | Tools | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 600,250 ms | 16,835 / 3,932 | 20,767 | 6 | 6 | outer timeout |
| 2 | 600,295 ms | 17,318 / 8,471 | 25,789 | 8 | 7 | outer timeout |
| 3 | 600,266 ms | 5,742 / 8,304 | 14,046 | 8 | 7 | outer timeout |
| 4 | 536,590 ms | 23,083 / 5,440 | 28,523 | 8 | 7 | completed; unresolved |

Rupi did not resolve in four turns. It used 89,125 work tokens over 2,337,401 ms, with 30
requests and 27 tools. The first three calls timed out; the fourth completed before its outer
limit. All oracle, project-test, and help checks failed on every turn. The service and help
commands could not run because Python reported that `receiptledger.__main__` was missing.
Project-test discovery could not import the `tests` start directory.

| Pi turn | Elapsed | Input / output | Work tokens | Requests | Tools | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 600,301 ms | 7,413 / 548 | 7,961 | 6 | 6 | outer timeout |
| 2 | 600,306 ms | 0 / 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | outer timeout; no model request |
| 3 | 600,311 ms | 1,053 / 188 | 1,241 | 2 | 2 | outer timeout |
| 4 | 600,232 ms | 0 / 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | outer timeout; no model request |

Pi did not resolve in four turns. It used 9,202 work tokens over 2,401,150 ms, with eight
requests and eight tools. Every turn timed out. All oracle, project-test, and help checks failed
on every turn. On turns 2 and 4, the recorded request and tool counts were zero. On the final
turn, Python could not import `receiptledger`, so the service and help commands failed.
Project-test discovery could not import the `tests` start directory.

## Outcome

The result is inconclusive because neither agent resolved the oracle. Rupi used 79,923 more work
tokens and finished 63,749 ms sooner. Both attempts failed to provide an importable service, and
both failed project-test discovery and all help checks. This completes the ten-case comparison.

## Active improvement slice: public audit and receipt guidance

Base: `8ba8010257d9114b9d780ca46b0bb76b9a726931` (merged Case09 PR144).
Branch: `fix/case10-audit-ledger`. Owner: parent agent, single writer; no delegation.
Cases01–09 have recorded configured wins and are skipped. Case10 remains unresolved.

Implement shared initial/repair prompts containing the complete actual Case10 public SPEC.
Preserve authenticated atomic DAG admission, ordered declared data flow, bounded workers,
private claim-token fencing, stable delivery keys and lost-ack receipt recovery. Emphasize
same-transaction audit appends, safe bounded events, the exact public hash expression, and
read-only full-chain verification/tail. Request public command/HTTP tests and an honest README.

Add isolated Case10 reasoning-budget and progress-mode/window selectors using the existing
runtime. Defaults remain zero budget, one_shot and window1; normalize mode capitalization.
Both agents receive the same complete public requirements and oracle pass/fail only. Rupi
uses four file tools and empty discovery; Pi0.86.1 uses six native file tools and disabled
discovery. Pi request/progress limits remain unavailable, never represented as zero.

Verify default/selected guards, non-native rejection before mutation, oracle isolation,
all18 non-Case10 initial/repair prompt hashes, copied SPEC/acceptance hashes, actual configs,
metadata and byte-identical shared initial prompts. Run a fresh same-Qwen paired comparison
with low/configured2048, Recurring/window3/cap12, matched six attempts of600s/grace6. Record
per-turn summaries and file metadata only; no generated source, model output, oracle source,
diagnostics or aggregate comparison results are inspected. No manual solution is supplied.

Acceptance remains unchanged. A failed cheaper run is inconclusive. A win requires fewer
acceptance-resolution turns or less recorded work at equal resolution turns. Recorded work
excludes cache-read tokens; unfinished inference is unknown. Keep public-test/help/README
limitations explicit and do not claim full-task completion or default/causal superiority.

Before delivery, perform author invariant review, required Rust checks and startup budget
verification; wait for exact-head three-platform CI before autonomous merge. Push progress
regularly. Verify the squash tree/remote main, detach artifacts, and delete merged branches.
Broader roadmap gates remain active. Status: plan committed; implementation/verification pending.
