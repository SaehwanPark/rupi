title: "Project Design Canonical"
author: "Sae-Hwan Park"
date: 2026-09-04

**Status:** Canonical design draft  
**Project:** `rupi`  
**Primary language:** Rust  
**Design lineage:** Heavily inspired by Pi  
**Document purpose:** Define the stable project philosophy, architectural boundaries, runtime primitives, UX principles, compatibility goals, and staged implementation direction for `rupi`.

---

## 1. Project Definition

`rupi` is a clean Rust reimplementation of the core ideas behind Pi, designed as a minimal coding-agent runtime with stronger first-class support for:

- execution observability and provenance;
- local and remote models;
- long-running context lifecycle management;
- graceful model failover;
- MCP-based interoperability;
- Pi ecosystem compatibility;
- provenance-aware external knowledge;
- replayable, inspectable agent execution.

The project is **not** intended to be a source rewrite, fork, or Rust translation of Pi internals.

It should instead preserve Pi's most valuable behavioral and philosophical properties while making a small number of runtime capabilities foundational where doing so substantially improves reliability, transparency, composability, or local-model usability.

A concise project description is:

> **`rupi` is a minimal, Pi-inspired and Pi-compatible agent runtime for observable, context-efficient, fault-tolerant coding sessions across local and remote models.**

A shorter design mantra is:

> **Minimal core. Compatible ecosystem. Observable execution. Honest provenance. Recoverable state.**

---

## 2. Why `rupi` Exists

The project should not exist merely because Rust is appealing.

A language-only port would provide insufficient differentiation and could fragment the Pi ecosystem without creating enough value.

`rupi` is justified by a specific architectural thesis:

> **The coding-agent runtime should remain small, but execution state, provenance, context lifecycle, interoperability, and recovery should be explicit runtime primitives rather than loosely coupled afterthoughts.**

This matters particularly for:

- experimental open-weight models;
- local inference servers;
- long-running coding sessions;
- agent behavior auditing;
- higher-level orchestration;
- context-sensitive latency;
- model/provider instability;
- reproducible research into agent execution.

Rust is the substrate that makes a compact native implementation, strong typed boundaries, predictable resource management, and low-overhead execution attractive.

Rust is not the project's raison d'être.

---

## 3. Foundational Design Philosophy

### 3.1 Preserve Pi's core philosophy

`rupi` should benchmark against and learn heavily from Pi's design language.

The project should preserve, as far as practical:

- a small conceptual agent loop;
- model/provider flexibility;
- terminal-first interaction;
- plain and inspectable sessions;
- user-controlled workflows;
- extensibility over built-in feature accumulation;
- package/skill/prompt-based customization;
- a low-friction default experience.

`rupi` should feel familiar to Pi users.

Where it differs, the difference should usually come from stronger runtime semantics rather than from adding workflow complexity.

### 3.2 Reimplementation, not rewrite

Compatibility should be behavioral.

The project should not mechanically reproduce Pi's implementation architecture when Rust-native boundaries are cleaner.

The core question should be:

> Does this preserve the expected semantics and ecosystem behavior?

not:

> Does this look internally like Pi?

### 3.3 Minimalism means minimal fundamental primitives

Minimalism should not be interpreted as "the core does almost nothing."

A runtime primitive belongs in core when it is fundamental to reliable execution and when every implementation of the feature would otherwise need to reproduce the same fragile machinery.

This allows core support for:

- event tracing;
- context lifecycle;
- session persistence;
- model failover;
- provider capability checks;
- tool transaction state;
- interoperability boundaries.

It should still exclude:

- multi-agent workflow policy;
- domain-specific research pipelines;
- opinionated software-development methodology;
- model voting;
- project-management systems;
- built-in browser or domain logic when extensions or MCP are appropriate.

### 3.4 Context is a cache, not the record

This is one of the project's central invariants.

The model's active prompt is a replaceable working set.

The durable execution trace is the canonical record.

```text
append-only execution history
            |
            +-------------------+
            |                   |
            v                   v
         replay            context engine
                                |
                                v
                       bounded working set
                                |
                                v
                              model
```

Compaction may remove information from active model context.

It must not silently erase the canonical execution record.

### 3.5 Working memory is disposable; evidence should be recoverable

Information should not be modeled as only:

```text
remembered
forgotten
```

A better model is:

```text
resident
compacted
rehydratable
```

This is especially important for:

- large tool results;
- external documentation;
- RKB evidence;
- prior coding episodes;
- archived checkpoints;
- reproducible traces.

### 3.6 Honest provenance

Any reasoning-like content must identify where it came from.

The runtime must never imply access to hidden chain-of-thought that a provider did not expose.

The user should always be able to distinguish:

- actual model-emitted reasoning;
- provider-generated reasoning summaries;
- intentionally declared rationales;
- post-hoc reconstructed rationales.

### 3.7 One model is active at a time

Normal `rupi` execution is not an ensemble.

The core runtime may have:

- one primary model;
- one optional backup model.

Only one model drives the agent at a time.

Multi-model orchestration, voting, judging, and delegation belong outside the core or in explicit extensions.

### 3.8 Conservative automation

Automatic runtime behavior should be predictable.

Examples:

- retries before failover;
- compaction only at safe boundaries;
- no silent destructive reset;
- no blind replay of uncertain side effects;
- no arbitrary quality-based model switching;
- no eager connection of every configured MCP server;
- no automatic injection of large external evidence when references suffice.

### 3.9 Quiet by default; rich when inspected

The interface should not expose every internal mechanism constantly.

Normal interaction should remain calm.

Detailed provenance, trace data, context statistics, MCP information, and reasoning history should be available when requested.

### 3.10 Instant before complete

The runtime should become usable before every optional subsystem finishes initialization.

The engineering version is:

> **Eager only for the critical path; lazy everywhere else.**

---

## 4. Project Goals

### 4.1 Primary goals

`rupi` should:

1. remain recognizably Pi-like in interaction and philosophy;
2. support common Pi ecosystem artifacts with little or no modification;
3. run as a small, responsive native Rust application;
4. support both local and remote models;
5. preserve exposed reasoning and execution provenance;
6. provide explicit reasoning provenance;
7. support long-running sessions through native context lifecycle management;
8. preserve canonical trace state across compactions;
9. expose and consume MCP capabilities;
10. support external orchestration without embedding orchestration policy;
11. gracefully continue through primary model/provider failures when a backup is configured;
12. make external evidence durable and rehydratable;
13. require little configuration for normal use.

### 4.2 Secondary goals

The project should also be suitable for:

- local-model experimentation;
- agent behavior research;
- execution auditing;
- reproducible debugging;
- replay and post-hoc analysis;
- integration into larger agent systems;
- development of domain-specific first-party extensions.

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Goals

The initial core should not become:

- a multi-agent framework;
- an autonomous software-development organization simulator;
- a model router for quality/cost optimization;
- an ensemble/voting system;
- a judge-model framework;
- a built-in browser automation suite;
- a domain-specific knowledge base;
- a project-management platform;
- a hidden-chain-of-thought extraction system;
- a dashboard-heavy terminal application.

These capabilities may exist outside core through:

- extensions;
- skills;
- MCP;
- external orchestrators;
- companion applications.

---

## 6. High-Level Architecture

                  +-------------+--------------+

                rkb-rs        GitHub         Browser
```

The reverse direction supports orchestration:

```text
higher-level orchestrator
          |
         MCP
          |
          v
        rupi
          |
     coding session
```

---

## 7. Core Runtime Components

A possible crate-level decomposition is:

```text
rupi-core
rupi-provider
rupi-session
rupi-context
rupi-trace
rupi-tools
rupi-mcp
rupi-pi-compat
rupi-cli
rupi-tui
```

Exact crate boundaries may evolve.

The conceptual boundaries should remain stable:

- agent execution;
- provider normalization;
- session state;
- context lifecycle;
- tools;
- event tracing;
- interoperability;
- Pi compatibility;
- terminal UX.

---

## 8. Event-Driven Runtime

Important runtime actions should produce typed events.

An explicitly configured caller completion observation may gate ordinary closure within
bounded turn/check budgets. Core owns the typed decision and preserves unavailable/failed
distinctions; the caller owns domain checks and isolates their effects outside the canonical
workspace. Diagnostic feedback is external evidence, separate from static runtime controls
and native assistant output. Cancellation and Unknown-effect barriers retain precedence.
Unavailable observations end semantic failure without retry, failover or check replay.
Neither an observation nor model self-review certifies overall task correctness.
An explicitly configured timed review may request a fresh caller observation before the
next model request without waiting for a final assistant answer. Share the ordinary check
allowance and external provenance; observations do not release progress barriers. A pass
does not replace review or a fresh final check. Unavailable observations and exhausted
allowance retain their terminal semantics. This must not add execution authority or replay.
Caller snapshot and artifact paths must support child process startup as well as file
creation. A short isolated scratch root may coexist with a run-local mailbox; preserve
artifacts and keep both outside the canonical workspace. Path-layout failures remain
unavailable observations and cannot justify replaying an uncertain check.

A conceptual schema:

```rust
enum AgentEvent {
  SessionStarted,
  UserInput,
  RuntimeControlInjected,
  UserMessage, // ambiguous legacy event; not proof of human authorship
  ModelRequest,
  ReasoningDelta,
  AssistantDelta,
  ToolRequested,
  ToolStarted,
  ToolCompleted,
  ToolFailed,
  ExternalContextRetrieved,
  ContextReduced,
  ContextCompactionStarted,
  ContextCompactionCompleted,
  CheckpointCreated,
  ModelRetry,
  ModelFailover,
  SessionEnded,
}
```

Events should carry relevant metadata such as:

```text
event_id
session_id
turn_id
timestamp
model_epoch
provider
model
tool_call_id
parent_event_id
trace_id
span_id
```

The same event stream should support:

- session persistence;
- TUI rendering;
- trace output;
- replay;
- model failover reconstruction;
- context lifecycle;
- OpenTelemetry or other optional exporters.

Avoid separate ad hoc logging systems for each subsystem.

A canonical message's semantic origin is independent of provider wire role and is validated
against its role. Human input and runtime-injected control use distinct event variants. Legacy
`UserMessage` records cannot prove who authored their text; migration may promote an origin only
when a linked canonical event provides unambiguous evidence. Otherwise the message remains
`ImportedLegacy` and may be preserved as opaque context, not promoted into user authority.

---

## 9. Session State and Trace Storage

Two logical representations should exist.

### 9.1 Semantic session state

Suitable for:

- resumption;
- branching;
- user inspection;
- Pi compatibility;
- reconstruction of active context.

Example:

```text
session.jsonl
```

### 9.2 High-resolution trace

A detailed event journal:

```text
trace.jsonl
```

Large payloads should be stored separately when appropriate:

```text
artifacts/
blobs/
tool-results/
```

Blob payload compression is an optional storage policy, disabled by default. The
append-only JSONL trace remains plain and appendable; only content-addressed payload
bytes may use a recorded encoding such as Deflate. A compressed reference keeps the
hash and size of the redacted logical bytes, so old raw references remain readable and
redaction still precedes hashing and encoding.

The runtime should be able to reconstruct what happened without loading every large payload into active memory.

---

## 10. Reasoning Transparency and Provenance

Reasoning-like information should use explicit provenance categories.

### 10.1 Native reasoning

Actual reasoning content emitted by the model/provider.

```text
provenance = native
```

Preserve it as faithfully as practical. When the provider exposes native reasoning, retain
its text and provenance in a successfully completed assistant message so canonical session
history can represent what was exposed. Failed or truncated attempts remain trace-only.
Storage is independent of replay: future requests include native reasoning only when the
endpoint explicitly opts in, and generic endpoint constructors make no native-exposure claim.
Replay configuration that conflicts with `exposed_reasoning != native` is invalid. When the
endpoint has not declared an exposure, reasoning-shaped fields are omitted from normalized events
rather than guessed from field names; raw provider payload retention remains opt-in.

### 10.2 Provider summary

A provider-generated summary or transformed representation of hidden reasoning.

```text
provenance = provider_summary
```

Never describe this as raw chain-of-thought.

### 10.3 Declared rationale

An optional compact explanation intentionally requested from the model around meaningful decisions.

Example:

```json
{
  "intent": "change the cache API",
  "evidence": [
    "all callers are internal"
  ],
  "expected_effect": "remove duplicated validation"
}
```

```text
provenance = declared
```

This is a model-generated explanation, not recovered private reasoning.

### 10.4 Reconstructed rationale

A post-hoc inference based on:

- visible context;
- tool calls;
- tool results;
- edits;
- later behavior.

```text
provenance = reconstructed
```

It should render explicitly as inferred:

```text
≈ RECONSTRUCTED RATIONALE
Not original model reasoning.
```

---

## 11. Replay

Replay should become a first-class capability after the foundational runtime is stable.

Potential interfaces:

```bash
rupi replay session.jsonl
rupi replay session.jsonl --tools
rupi replay session.jsonl --reasoning
rupi replay session.jsonl --timing
rupi replay session.jsonl --until event:381
```

Longer-term possibilities:

- branch from an historical event;
- reconstruct exact model-visible context at a given point;
- compare model continuations from the same historical state;
- inspect compaction effects;
- visualize failover epochs;
- audit tool side effects.

Historical execution must remain clearly separated from newly generated continuation. The
verified `rupi-replay` boundary treats replay as a pure projection over redacted trace entries
joined with persisted session messages; it uses sequence numbers for order, preserves explicit
reasoning provenance, and emits dry historical branch plans rather than executing them. Context
snapshots keep canonical history intact while representing compaction/checkpoint substitutions
only in the model-visible working projection.

---

## 12. Pi Ecosystem Compatibility

Compatibility should be explicit, versioned, and tested.

A likely target hierarchy:

| Surface | Target |
|---|---|
| Skills / `SKILL.md` | Very high |
| Prompt templates | Very high |
| Package discovery | Very high |
| Package installation | Very high |
| Package manifests | High |
| Session import/export | High |
| Themes | High |
| Extension tools | High |
| Extension commands | High |
| Extension lifecycle events | High |
| Complex custom UI | Best effort |
| Arbitrary Pi internal imports | Not guaranteed |

A compatibility tool could eventually report:

```text
Pi compatibility

✓ skills
✓ prompts
✓ registerTool
✓ registerCommand
△ custom TUI widget
✗ internal Pi module import
```

Compatibility should be measured through fixtures and integration tests rather than broad claims.

---

## 13. TypeScript Extension Compatibility

Existing Pi TypeScript extensions are strategically important.

Do not force them to become Rust extensions.

A Node compatibility host is preferred initially and is implemented as the optional
`rupi-extension` adapter. It accepts trusted module paths and exposes only the selected
Pi API subset through a typed JSON-lines boundary:

```text
                 rupi
                   |
             extension RPC
                   |
                   v
        +----------------------+
        | Node extension host  |
        +----------------------+
                   |
              Pi extensions
```

Advantages:

- npm dependencies remain available;
- arbitrary Node packages continue to work;
- existing Pi extension code may run with minimal changes;
- the Rust process remains isolated from JavaScript complexity.

Later, a native extension path may coexist:

```text
TypeScript extensions -> compatibility path
Rust/WASM extensions  -> native path
```

The Node host starts lazily only when required. Constructing an empty host and inspecting
compatibility fixtures do not launch Node. Extension exceptions and process loss remain
adapter errors; mutating extension tools preserve explicit `Unknown` completion semantics
rather than being silently converted to success or observed failure.

---

## 14. Context Lifecycle System

Context lifecycle management belongs in the runtime.

It should generalize the design lessons from `local-context-manager`.

The system should maintain:

```text
1. FORENSIC TRACE
   complete observable history

2. WORKING CONTEXT
   bounded prompt supplied to the model

3. DURABLE SEMANTIC STATE
   checkpoints, capsules, artifact references
```

The working context may forget.

The trace must not.

---

## 15. Context Management Levels

### L0: Payload reduction / eviction

Oversized tool results or external evidence need not remain resident in the prompt.

Example:

```text
Full result:
  18,000 tokens
```

may become:

```text
Large result archived as artifact://abc123

Relevant excerpts:
...

Retrieve artifact if full detail becomes necessary.
```

The original remains durable.

### L1: Ordinary compaction

Older conversational content is summarized while recent context remains verbatim.

### L2: Semantic phase compaction

Compaction can occur because a meaningful task phase has ended, not merely because the context window is nearly full.

Good boundaries include:

- implementation complete;
- tests passing;
- debugging episode resolved;
- investigation concluded;
- PR ready.

### L3: Episode checkpoint/reset

A larger semantic episode may be archived and replaced by a continuation capsule.

Useful boundaries include:

- PR merged;
- issue resolved;
- release completed;
- deployment completed;
- research episode finished;
- context budget pressure reaching checkpoint thresholds (`ContextAction::SuggestCheckpoint`).

Compaction policy interaction:
A checkpoint capsule forms an impermeable barrier for ordinary compaction (L1/L2). Compaction operates only on messages accumulated after the most recent checkpoint and never attempts to summarize across or rewrite an established checkpoint capsule. When a checkpoint is created, the working message history is reset to the capsule's structured model representation, advancing the context epoch (`ContextCompactionCompleted(Level::L3Checkpoint)`). On session resume, context hydration initializes with the active checkpoint capsule followed by subsequent turn messages.

Session-changing actions should remain reviewable.

---

## 16. Structured Context Capsules

Compaction should prefer structured semantic state over a single free-form summary.

Example:

```yaml
objective:
  Fix lifetime handling in session cache.

completed:
  - Located stale-entry bug.
  - Changed cache invalidation logic.
  - Added regression tests.

decisions:
  - Preserve current public Cache API.
  - Avoid Arc<RwLock<_>> migration.

current_state:
  tests: passing
  working_tree: clean

important_artifacts:
  - src/cache.rs
  - tests/cache_regression.rs

constraints:
  - preserve API compatibility

unresolved:
  - benchmark allocation impact

next_actions:
  - run benchmarks
  - open PR
```

The semantic representation may later be rendered differently for different models. Runtime
messages retain this semantic state in typed `DerivedSummary` variants (`Capsule`, `Phase`,
`Rendered`, or `Opaque`) rather than relying on re-parsing rendered prompt text during later
compactions. Typed capsules and phase wrappers carry forward their fields recursively; custom
prose and unattributed legacy text are retained as bounded opaque unresolved context. Neither is
reclassified as a newly authored user instruction. Each canonical `ContextCompactionEpoch` also
persists this typed state; session restore verifies the message projection against the canonical
event and rejects semantic-state tampering.

---

## 17. Context Profiles

Most users should not tune thresholds manually.

Built-in profiles:

```text
aggressive
balanced
relaxed
```

`balanced` is the invisible default.

Selection should be symptom-driven:

```text
Growing sessions become sluggish -> aggressive
Everything feels comfortable     -> balanced
Compaction happens too often     -> relaxed
```

The model's reported context window may lower thresholds for constrained models.

Large advertised windows should not automatically increase thresholds. Explicit numeric
`ContextOverrides` are applied after deriving the profile thresholds for each active model
window, including a failover backup. Values are normalized to preserve
`warn <= reduce <= compact < checkpoint < window` and `recent_target < compact`; any
normalization is recorded as a durable diagnostic. When opt-in adaptive mode observes a
model-specific performance knee, the knee is applied after the overrides and may only
lower those thresholds further.

When an endpoint declares an output ceiling, each request is budgeted from the assembled
system prompt, messages, and exposed tools plus the desired output. The resolver deducts a safety
reserve when computing the effective allowance; that reserve constrains the wire ceiling but is
not itself a model token. The runtime keeps desired and effective output limits distinct; the
effective value is the exact wire limit.
If a useful output allowance does not fit, only safe pre-turn history may be evicted before
dispatch, and the runtime refuses if that still cannot fit. An undeclared ceiling is not
invented. Backup rebudgeting uses the same exact request construction and budget. Token-estimator
calibration remains separate and deferred.

Advanced numerical configuration can exist for specialized benchmarking.

---

## 18. Future Adaptive Context Policy

A later experimental subsystem may learn context-performance behavior from:

```text
model context size
+
observed prefill latency
+
KV-cache behavior
+
cache hits
+
hardware/runtime
         |
         v
dynamic effective context policy
```

For example, a local model may technically support 128k tokens while becoming unpleasantly slow above 30k.

The runtime could eventually learn this performance knee.

This should not be required for the initial implementation.

---

## 19. MCP Client

MCP should be a first-party interoperability subsystem.

MCP capabilities should normalize into the same internal tool abstraction used by native tools and extensions.
The client supports lazy stdio and bounded Streamable HTTP POST activation: JSON or matching
response-SSE, session-id propagation, bounded bodies, and JSON-RPC id validation. One-shot
HTTP calls use bounded, cancellation-aware local relays with fail-closed interruption;
long-lived server push remains an optional future capability.

Discovered tools pass an admission boundary before entering the registry or a model
request. Configured-server and server-supplied name parts must be provider-safe; tool
descriptions are bounded to 4 KiB, schemas to 16 KiB, depth 32, and 4,096 nodes. Catalogs
are limited to 64 tools per server and 128 active tools overall, with per-server and global
metadata budgets. An omitted root schema type normalizes to `object`; invalid or over-budget
catalogs fail closed and are not partially exposed. These limits bound the active metadata
surface; selective activation within large catalogs remains future work.

Conceptually:

```rust
Tool
  |- BuiltinTool
  |- ExtensionTool
  `- McpTool
```

The model should not need to care whether a capability is implemented natively, through an extension, or by MCP.

---

## 20. Lazy MCP Capability Exposure

A configured environment may contain hundreds of MCP tools.

Injecting every schema into model context is undesirable, especially for local models.

`rupi` should support lazy discovery or filtering.

Potential mechanisms:

```text
/mcp enable github
/mcp enable rkb
```

or:

```text
mcp.search_capabilities(...)
mcp.call(...)
```

or skill-driven activation.

The exact design can remain experimental.

The invariant is:

> Connecting MCP servers must not imply permanent exposure of every tool schema to every model turn.

---

## 21. MCP Server / Worker Mode

`rupi-mcp::worker` now provides the explicit MCP-accessible worker boundary. An embedding
application supplies a trusted headless `WorkerEngine`; the adapter owns asynchronous run
handles, cancellation, bounded waits, and stable JSON projections rather than terminal
transcript scraping.

The verified semantic operations are:

```text
agent.start
agent.continue
agent.cancel
agent.branch
agent.compact
```

The verified resources are:

```text
session://<id>/state
session://<id>/summary
session://<id>/messages
session://<id>/trace
session://<id>/diff
session://<id>/artifacts
session://<id>/checkpoint/latest
```

The summary projection carries explicit external provenance and remains separate from the
coarse trace projection. Raw event payloads, implementation paths, and hidden reasoning are
not exposed. Checkpoint and historical-event branching belong to replay tooling until an
engine supplies historical snapshots; unavailable diff and artifact producers return typed
availability rather than fabricated results.

---

## 22. Higher-Level Orchestration Boundary

Higher-level orchestration belongs outside the runtime.

Example:

```text
                  ORCHESTRATOR
                       |
            +----------+----------+
            |          |          |
            v          v          v
         rupi A    rupi B    rupi C
         backend    frontend    reviewer
```

Each `rupi` worker may independently be:

- stateful;
- inspectable;
- resumable;
- compactable;
- auditable;
- fault tolerant.

The orchestrator should operate mainly on semantic state rather than ingesting every worker trace.

This keeps the coding harness minimal while making it composable.

---

## 23. External Context and Rehydration

External knowledge should be represented as a durable reference rather than only pasted text.

The generic durable contract is:

```rust
struct ExternalContextRef {
  provider: String,
  resource_id: String,
  citation: Option<String>,
  provenance: String,
  metadata: BTreeMap<String, String>,
}
```

Working context may contain a temporary textual rendering. `ExternalContextItem` can
replace that rendering with a reference while preserving source metadata, and a
provider-owned resolver can later return a fresh inline item. Retrieval messages retain
the typed reference in session state and the retrieval event remains in canonical trace.

This allows evidence to be:

```text
retrieved
  |
resident in context
  |
compacted to reference + conclusion
  |
rehydrated when needed
```

---

## 24. `rkb-rs` First-Party Integration

`rkb-rs` should remain an independent domain-specific project.

It should not become a core dependency.

Instead:

```text
rupi core
  `- generic external-context primitives

rupi-rkb
  `- official integration

rkb-rs
  `- independent knowledge system
```

The integration provides:

- pure setup/discovery for the verified `rkb mcp` stdio contract;
- a bundled skill describing when to use RKB;
- citation-aware rendering with source URL/document/page metadata;
- durable RKB record IDs and generic `ExternalContextRef` conversion;
- evidence-aware inline-to-reference compaction;
- exact-id `search_chunks` rehydration hooks;
- lazy MCP activation with read-only retrieval tools.

`rkb-rs` remains an independent project and is not a dependency of `rupi-core`.
`rupi-rkb` serves as the architectural reference implementation for provenance-aware
external knowledge.

The generic feature extracted into `rupi` is not "RAG."

It is:

> **provenance-aware, rehydratable external context.**

---

## 25. Model Failover

Model failover is a core reliability feature, not orchestration.

A simple configuration:

```toml
[model]
primary = "local/qwen"
backup = "openai/gpt"
```

Only one model is active at a time.

---

## 26. Failover Semantics

The sequence should be deterministic:

```text
primary request
      |
    failure
      |
 classify
      |
 retryable?
  |       |
 yes      no
  |       |
bounded   |
retry     |
  |       |
fails ----+
      |
      v
backup model
```

Retry should precede failover only when replay is proven safe. A retryable failure kind
alone is insufficient: each `ModelFailure` carries `RequestReplaySafety` with `Safe`,
`AmbiguousPostBoundary`, or `CommittedOutput`. A known pre-dispatch failure or an explicit
retry-safe HTTP response may retry; an ambiguous POST skips same-model retry and moves
directly to the configured failover decision. Committed output is not eligible for generic
retries or failover replay.

An explicit output-limit completion (`length` or `max_tokens`) has one narrow exception:
when reported output usage is known and strictly below the request's explicit effective output
ceiling, pre-turn history can be safely compacted, and no assistant text or reasoning has escaped
to an irreversible live surface, the runtime may retry once on the same model. The failed deltas
and unexecuted tool calls remain canonical trace evidence but are omitted from model-visible
projections; no call from the incomplete response is executed. Full-ceiling, unmeasured,
uncompactable, or user-visible cases remain incomplete.

Provider decoders and the runtime collector impose finite per-response bounds on text,
reasoning, semantic event count, raw SSE frame count/size, tool count, tool identities, and
per-call/aggregate tool arguments. Empty and usage-only frames count toward the independent raw
frame bound. Fragmented argument builders are checked before append. Text-limit failures are
incomplete semantic responses; no partially accumulated tool call may execute.

### Eligible automatic failover cases

Examples:

- provider outage;
- local server unavailable;
- connection refusal;
- repeated transport failures;
- timeout after retries;
- provider 5xx;
- persistent rate limit;
- unrecoverable stream interruption;
- endpoint disappearance;
- repeated malformed provider/model protocol output.

### Non-failover cases

Do not automatically fail over because:

- the answer is mediocre;
- tests fail;
- the implementation is poor;
- the model appears confused;
- the model disagrees with the user.

Those are quality/orchestration concerns.

---

## 27. Mid-Turn Failover

The backup must continue from actual committed execution state.

Example:

```text
primary:
  read file
  edit file
  run test
  [connection lost]
```

The backup should see the committed read/edit/test events and continue from there.

The whole turn must not simply replay.

This requires the session to exist independently from the active model.

---

## 28. Tool Transaction State

Tool calls should have durable lifecycle states:

```text
Requested
Started
Succeeded
Failed
Unknown
```

A stable tool-call ID should be recorded. The runtime, not an individual adapter, enforces
non-empty unique call IDs across all executable and rejected calls in one provider response.
Every member of a collision receives a fresh internal lifecycle ID and is rejected together
before dispatch.

Each `ToolRequested` record should also persist a stable tool-definition fingerprint when the
tool declares trustworthy identity: source, definition ID, reconciliation-contract version,
normalized schema hash, and risk metadata. Process-local registry generations are not durable
identity. After restart, automatic reconciliation of a mutating call is allowed only when the
current definition exactly matches the saved fingerprint; a missing or changed fingerprint
requires manual inspection and the replacement's `reconcile()` must not run.

Mutation-budget capacity is reserved at execution admission. It may be released only when a
typed stale-binding result proves that a replacement race refused the call before `Started`;
other refusals and uncertain outcomes keep conservative accounting.

If a side-effecting operation has `Unknown` completion state, the runtime must not blindly replay it after failover.

Read-only operations are more safely retryable.

For explicitly bounded implementation workflows, an opt-in progress boundary may count
model requests that invoke tools without calling a configured progress tool. When the
boundary activates, the runtime records its instruction, narrows the next request's tool
schemas to the configured progress tools (or permitted mutating tools when no allowlist is
supplied), and requests required tool choice where the provider supports it. That hint is
not enforcement: a text-only completion while the boundary remains active is retained in
the canonical trace but excluded from model-visible history and final report text, then
followed by a corrective request. Exhausting the request budget without a successful
configured progress tool is `BudgetExhausted`, never `Completed`. The normal `Requested`,
`Started`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, or `Unknown` lifecycle remains authoritative; an
attempt or a failed tool does not satisfy the boundary. A successful configured progress
tool satisfies the default one-shot boundary for the rest of that turn. Explicit recurring
mode instead resets the inspection window after each observed change and rejects text-only
completion before any change in the turn, including bypass through reserved finalization.
No-tool recovery assessments remain separate. Recurring mode requires a configured progress
limit; it does not enable progress enforcement for unconfigured callers.
At activation and before each
later request, the runtime resolves the effective executable set under current model capabilities,
tool policy, and approval availability; an empty set is a durable semantic failure before another
request, not a retry loop (including when failover changes capabilities). The default remains
disabled so read-only tasks are not forced to mutate.

An optional turn-time budget may use a monotonic deadline and linked cancellation
token to cooperatively stop provider and tool work. Its remaining-time guidance must
be runtime-owned, canonical, and projected with explicit provenance. Deadline expiry
must not cancel the caller or siblings, dispatch incomplete calls, replay uncertain
mutations, or initiate recovery inference. Unknown/Possible effects keep the
reconciliation barrier. The default remains disabled, and foreign operations that do
not cooperate may exceed the deadline.

A caller with already authorized implementation work and sufficient context may select
an initial progress boundary when a progress window is configured. Activate it only
after admission, cancellation, reconciliation and current approval-availability checks;
reuse normal tool eligibility and confirmed Changed evidence. Renew selection each turn,
skip explicit no-tools assessment, and keep the default disabled. This does not infer
task intent, enforce case artifacts or expand mutation authorization.

An optional positive initial progress output ceiling may bound only the first ordinary
request of that active boundary, renewed each turn. Respect smaller endpoint ceilings
and context admission, keep desired/effective budgets explicit, and retain normal output
limits on later requests even if progress is still unsatisfied. Guidance may ask for a
small coherent completed first change; it cannot claim correctness, enforce artifacts,
dispatch incomplete tool calls or replay a failed response. Default omission is unchanged.

A separately selected initial string-argument limit may constrain mutating tools in
that first request. Capture the restriction with the request, advertise Unicode scalar
bounds in request-local schemas without changing registry identities, and reject
completed oversized calls before dispatch with known no effect. Count total calls,
retain progress requirements, and renew only on a new turn. Later requests keep normal
tool contracts. Guidance may ask for incremental complete changes, but cannot authorize
new effects, impose domain artifacts or turn incomplete responses into executable calls.

An optional initial thinking selection may override only that first active-boundary
request, using the endpoint's declared encoding. Later requests inherit normal thinking,
even before progress is satisfied; fresh turns renew selection. Describe requested intent
without claiming observed hidden reasoning or backend compliance. Do not relax output,
tool, approval, cancellation or unresolved-effect safeguards to apply this selection.

Endpoint thinking dialects must preserve their declared wire keys. An explicitly selected
`chat_template_enable_thinking` dialect sends the boolean template toggle; do not conflate
it with the legacy `thinking` key or generic reasoning effort. A requested toggle is not
proof of effective backend enforcement, effort intensity or hidden reasoning composition.

A caller may opt into one bounded review after the first otherwise accepted ordinary
completion. Preserve native assistant evidence and record review instructions with
runtime provenance. Continue only through normal request/tool/time budgets, approval,
and reconciliation barriers on the active model. Do not enforce case-specific artifact
names or interpret review as external correctness certification. Defaults remain unchanged.
An optional positive remaining-time reserve below the turn duration may trigger the same
one-shot review before an ordinary provider attempt, including during ongoing tool work.
The observed preceding provider/tool cycle may anticipate spending that reserve; this
estimate resets each turn and cannot guarantee future latency or extend the deadline.
It must not bypass cancellation, budget, approval, or unresolved-effect barriers.

This is a distributed-systems-style reliability invariant.

---

## 29. Backup Compatibility Gate

The backup may differ from the primary.

The runtime should inspect capabilities such as:

```text
                     primary   backup
text                    yes      yes
images                  yes      no
tool calling            yes      yes
context window          128k     32k
reasoning exposed       yes      no
```

If the current context exceeds backup capacity:

```text
primary fails
    |
backup capability check
    |
context too large
    |
emergency compaction
    |
backup continues
```

If a required modality or capability is unavailable, the failover should be rejected or explicitly degraded rather than failing mysteriously.

---

## 30. Model Epochs and Provenance

A session may contain multiple execution epochs.

```text
Session
  |- Epoch 1
  |   model = Qwen
  |   reason = initial
  |
  `- Epoch 2
      model = GPT
      reason = failover
```

Trace rendering should show failover boundaries clearly:

```text
MODEL qwen
REASONING [native]
TOOL read
TOOL edit
ERROR connection reset

------ MODEL FAILOVER ------
from: local/qwen
to: openai/gpt
reason: endpoint unavailable
----------------------------

MODEL gpt
TOOL test
...
```

Different reasoning provenance after failover must remain explicit.

---

## 31. Failover Recovery Policy

Avoid automatic model ping-pong.

Initial policy:

> After automatic failover, the backup remains active until the user explicitly switches back.

Possible commands:

```text
/failover
/model-primary
/model-backup
```

Exact naming may evolve.

Automatic primary recovery can be considered later at safe boundaries.

---

## 32. Local Models as First-Class Citizens

The runtime should treat local inference as a serious primary use case.

Relevant concerns include:

- long prefill latency;
- finite context windows;
- exposed reasoning streams;
- model-specific tool formats;
- local endpoint crashes;
- quantization-dependent performance;
- runtime-specific quirks;
- slower cold model loading.

No single local runtime should be mandatory.

Likely provider targets include:

- llama.cpp-compatible servers;
- OpenAI-compatible local endpoints;
- pluggable custom providers.

---

## 33. UX and Visual Design Philosophy

The visual design should follow Pi's interaction language while refining readability and information hierarchy.

The north star:

> **Minimal chrome, high information density, strong visual hierarchy, and almost no decorative UI.**

### 33.1 Semantic rather than decorative styling

Color and typography should encode meaning.

Examples:

- operation names;
- arguments;
- paths;
- free-form prompts;
- native reasoning;
- reconstructed rationale;
- warnings;
- errors;
- failover;
- context compaction.

Do not add visual effects merely to look modern.

### 33.2 Syntax-highlight commands and operations

Example:

```text
/read src/context.rs
^^^^^ operation
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ argument
```

and:

```text
/compact-phase implementation complete; tests pass
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ operation
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ prompt/reason
```

Tool execution should also be easy to skim:

```text
read        src/context.rs
edit        src/session.rs
test        cargo test -p rupi-context
```

The operation, structured argument, path, and free text should have consistent visual roles.

### 33.3 Provenance should have a visual grammar

The following should never look identical:

```text
NATIVE REASONING
PROVIDER SUMMARY
DECLARED RATIONALE
RECONSTRUCTED RATIONALE
```

They should differ through restrained labels, icons, or text treatment.

### 33.4 Rare events should stand out

Examples:

- model failover;
- destructive checkpoint/reset;
- unrecoverable tool uncertainty;
- emergency compaction;
- provider authentication failure.

Routine reads and successful tools should remain visually quiet.

### 33.5 Collapse detail by default

Long content should be inspectable without dominating the session:

- reasoning;
- tool output;
- MCP payloads;
- trace metadata;
- large diffs;
- archived artifacts.

### 33.6 Avoid dashboardification

Do not permanently occupy the screen with:

- token gauges;
- MCP status panels;
- provider dashboards;
- trace IDs;
- multiple persistent panes;
- activity widgets.

A compact status line is preferable:

```text
qwen-local · ctx 21k/131k · balanced · git:main
```

Important changes should surface contextually:

```text
context compacted 31k -> 12k
```

```text
primary unavailable -> backup: gpt
```

### 33.7 Keyboard-first, terminal-native

The TUI should prioritize:

- immediate typing;
- predictable keyboard shortcuts;
- fuzzy completion;
- narrow-terminal behavior;
- restrained spacing;
- fast scrolling;
- low render overhead.

Core usability should not depend on exotic terminal features.

---

## 34. Command Design

Keep top-level commands small and semantic.

Prefer:

```text
/model
/context
/trace
/mcp
/checkpoints
/failover
```

Use subcommands, fuzzy completion, and contextual help for complexity.

Avoid accumulating dozens of narrowly scoped top-level commands.

The user should be able to discover advanced functionality without memorizing it.

---

## 35. Performance and Responsiveness

Performance is a user-facing design requirement.

A terminal agent that starts slowly or blocks on optional initialization feels heavy regardless of implementation language.

### 35.1 Critical principle

> **Do the minimum work required for the next interaction.**

### 35.2 Startup path

Startup should ideally perform only:

```text
process start
   |
   |- parse minimal config
   |- identify project
   |- restore lightweight session metadata
   |- initialize TUI
   `- READY
        |
        |- load extensions lazily
        |- discover MCP lazily
        |- initialize backup lazily
        |- hydrate deep history lazily
        `- open heavy indexes only when needed
```

The editor should become usable before optional services are fully ready.

### 35.3 Readiness stages

Conceptually track:

```text
T0 executable starts
T1 UI appears
T2 user can type
T3 first prompt can be submitted
T4 optional services fully ready
```

Optimize primarily for `T1` through `T3`.

`T4` may happen progressively.

### 35.4 Aspirational latency budgets

Early engineering targets may include:

```text
warm startup to interactive       <100 ms
cold startup to interactive       <250 ms
keypress/render latency             <16 ms
slash completion                     <50 ms
local session metadata lookup       <50 ms
```

These are targets, not promises.

They should be measured and revised empirically.

### 35.5 Avoid startup tax accumulation

A recurring audit should prevent:

```text
config parsing       +40 ms
package scanning     +80 ms
MCP discovery       +150 ms
git inspection      +100 ms
session hydration   +200 ms
```

from silently turning into sluggish startup.

### 35.6 Startup-path dependencies deserve stronger scrutiny

Dependencies on the startup critical path should require clear justification.

Avoid unnecessary:

- directory scans;
- full-history parsing;
- database initialization;
- network calls;
- provider discovery;
- Node startup;
- MCP server startup.

---

## 36. Lazy Loading Strategy

### 36.1 Backup model

The configured backup should normally incur nearly zero runtime cost until needed.

Do not connect to or load a second model simply because it is configured.

Warm standby may exist later as an explicit opt-in.

### 36.2 MCP

Configured MCP servers should not all connect at startup.

Start or connect only when:

- their capability is requested;
- the relevant skill activates;
- the user explicitly enables them.

Cache connections and schemas afterward where appropriate.

### 36.3 Pi extensions

Package manifests may be discovered cheaply.

Extension implementations should load only when needed.

The Node compatibility host should not start unless a TypeScript extension requires it.

### 36.4 Session restoration

Do not parse an enormous historical trace just to resume a session.

Prefer:

```text
session index
   |
latest checkpoint
   +
post-checkpoint active events
   |
working state
```

Historical trace remains cold until inspected.

### 36.5 External indexes

Heavy SQLite, FTS, vector, or knowledge-base indexes should open on first use unless needed for the initial prompt.

---

## 37. Context Management as a Performance Feature

Context lifecycle is not only about avoiding overflow.

For local models:

```text
larger context
    |
slower prefill
    |
longer time before response
    |
worse interactive UX
```

Therefore:

> **Optimize context for useful information per unit of inference cost, not maximum context utilization.**

A model supporting 128k tokens does not imply that routinely using 100k+ is desirable.

Proactive compaction can function as an inference-latency controller.

---

## 38. Immediate Feedback

When work itself is slow, the interface should still acknowledge progress immediately.

Example:

```text
read  src/parser.rs
grep  parse_expr
edit  src/parser.rs
test  cargo test parser
```

For provider delays, a subtle status is enough:

```text
qwen-local · generating
```

Avoid excessive spinners, animations, or noisy progress indicators.

---

## 39. Security and Privacy

Observability creates risk because traces may contain:

- source code;
- `.env` contents;
- secrets returned by tools;
- credentials;
- database URLs;
- private documents;
- personal information;
- model reasoning that repeats sensitive values;
- provider metadata.

A redaction pipeline should exist before durable logging:

```text
raw event
    |
redaction policy
    |
semantic event
    +--> trace
    +--> UI
    `--> telemetry
```

Raw provider payload capture should be optional and disabled by default.

Example:

```toml
[trace]
raw_provider_payloads = false
```

Sensitive artifacts should use restrictive filesystem permissions.

---

## 40. Project Trust

Project-local configuration should not silently gain powerful behavior in an untrusted repository.

Trust-sensitive capabilities include:

- enabling MCP servers;
- spawning subprocesses;
- loading extensions;
- modifying context policies;
- writing checkpoints outside normal locations;
- enabling custom native extensions.

Global and project configuration should have explicit precedence and trust rules. Compatibility
readers take trust as a caller-owned input, and `rupi trust` records canonical project scopes
in a private, schema-versioned store; no project file can grant its own trust. The current
interactive resolver remains deliberately explicit rather than guessing on `NeedsUser`.

---

## 41. Configuration Philosophy

A normal user's configuration should be small.

Example:

```toml
[model]
primary = "local/qwen"
backup = "openai/gpt"

[context]
mode = "balanced"
```

Everything else should have sensible defaults.

Advanced options may include:

- retry policy;
- trace retention;
- redaction;
- context thresholds;
- MCP activation;
- extension hosts;
- checkpoint storage;
- startup/performance diagnostics.

Users should not need to understand them to use the product well.

---

## 42. Core vs First-Party vs External

| Capability | Location |
|---|---|
| Agent loop | Core |
| Provider abstraction | Core |
| Tool execution | Core |
| Session persistence | Core |
| Event store | Core |
| Reasoning provenance | Core |
| Context lifecycle | Core |
| Model failover | Core |
| Tool transaction semantics | Core |
| Pi compatibility | Core / compatibility subsystem |
| MCP protocol support | First-party core subsystem |
| Node extension host | First-party |
| `rkb-rs` integration | First-party extension |
| Browser integration | Extension / MCP |
| Multi-agent orchestration | External / extension |
| Model voting/judging | External / extension |
| Domain-specific workflows | Extensions / skills |
| Domain-specific knowledge | External service / extension |

A feature should enter core only when it is fundamentally about runtime reliability, inspectability, compatibility, context, or composability.

---

## 43. Testing Strategy

### 43.1 Compatibility fixtures

Maintain fixtures for:

- Pi skills;
- prompts;
- package manifests;
- sessions;
- extension APIs.

CI should detect compatibility regressions.

### 43.2 Deterministic provider simulation

A fake provider should simulate:

- successful streaming;
- exposed reasoning;
- malformed reasoning;
- interruption;
- timeout;
- 429;
- 500;
- context overflow;
- malformed tool calls;
- provider disappearance.

### 43.3 Failover tests

Cover:

```text
failure before output
failure after reasoning
failure after read-only tool
failure after write
uncertain side-effect completion
smaller backup context
backup lacking modality
backup failure
```

### 43.4 Context invariants

Compaction tests should verify retention of:

- active objective;
- explicit user constraints;
- unresolved work;
- important artifacts;
- pending actions.

The original trace must survive all working-context compactions.

### 43.5 Replay invariants

Replay should preserve:

- event order;
- model epochs;
- tool lifecycle state;
- context transformations;
- provenance labels.

### 43.6 Performance tests

Measure at minimum:

- cold startup;
- warm startup;
- first keystroke readiness;
- session resume;
- slash completion;
- rendering latency;
- package discovery;
- Node host activation;
- MCP first-use latency.

Performance regressions should be visible in CI where practical.

---

## 44. Development Roadmap

### Phase 0: Design and contracts

Deliver:

- architecture document;
- canonical principles;
- compatibility matrix;
- event schema;
- provider abstraction;
- session format;
- explicit non-goals;
- UX/performance budgets.

### Phase 1: Minimal usable agent

Implement:

- CLI;
- minimal TUI;
- provider interface;
- one local provider path;
- one cloud-compatible path;
- basic coding tools;
- session persistence;
- responsive startup.

Goal:

> A small, useful coding agent exists before the advanced architecture grows around it.

### Phase 2: Event trace and provenance

Implement:

- event bus;
- high-resolution traces;
- reasoning provenance;
- tool lifecycle events;
- model epochs;
- basic trace inspection.

This should happen early because most later features depend on trustworthy events.

### Phase 3: Pi compatibility foundation

Implement:

- skills;
- prompts;
- package discovery;
- package installation;
- compatibility fixtures;
- session import/export where practical.

### Phase 4: Context lifecycle

Generalize the proven ideas from `local-context-manager`:

- context statistics;
- profiles;
- proactive safe-boundary compaction;
- oversized tool-result reduction;
- semantic phase compaction;
- checkpoint/reset;
- structured capsules;
- fast session restoration.

### Phase 5: Model failover

Implement:

- failure classification;
- bounded retry;
- primary/backup configuration;
- model epochs;
- backup capability checks;
- context rebudgeting;
- side-effect safeguards.

### Phase 6: MCP client

Implement:

- protocol abstraction;
- lazy server connection;
- tool discovery;
- capability filtering;
- tool normalization;
- protocol negotiation.

Use `rkb-rs` as an early integration fixture.

### Phase 7: `rkb-rs` first-party integration

Implement:

- setup/discovery;
- skill integration;
- provenance-preserving results;
- durable external references;
- evidence-aware compaction;
- rehydration.

Use this phase to refine generic external-context primitives.

### Phase 8: TypeScript extension compatibility

Implement:

- Node extension host;
- tool registration;
- commands;
- lifecycle events;
- context hooks;
- selected UI facilities.

Expand based on real ecosystem needs.

### Phase 9: MCP server / worker mode

Implement:

- start/resume/cancel;
- session resources;
- artifacts;
- summaries;
- trace access;
- long-running task semantics.

### Phase 10: Replay and research tooling

Add:

- deterministic `rupi replay` over canonical trace/session records;
- tools, reasoning, timing, and inclusive replay-until-event projections;
- historical model-visible context reconstruction with canonical/working separation;
- dry branch-from-event plans and structural continuation comparison;
- model-epoch, compaction, failover, provenance, and redacted trace-export analysis.

Replay remains read-only and never executes providers or tools. A historical branch plan is
explicitly separate from any future generated continuation, and uncertain mutating tool states
remain reconciliation barriers.

### Phase 11: Adaptive optimization experiments

Completed as opt-in experiments with verified baselines (`rupi-experiments` and `bench/context_prefill.sh`):

- learned context-performance knees: `KneeDetector` and `AdaptiveContextPolicy` cap thresholds at performance cliffs;
- optional warm backup: `evaluate_standby_tradeoff` models startup vs takeover trade-offs while keeping cold backup default;
- smarter MCP activation: `evaluate_mcp_exposure` models predictive prefetch while keeping minimal exposure default;
- first-event TTFT timing: `ModelRequestCompleted.first_delta_ms` records arrival timing with backward compatibility.

---

## 45. Initial MVP Boundary

The first public MVP should remain intentionally smaller than the full vision.

A strong MVP may include:

- native Rust binary;
- minimal sleek TUI;
- one local and one remote provider path;
- basic coding tools;
- persistent sessions;
- event trace;

## 46. Success Criteria

### 46.1 Compatibility

A Pi user can move common skills and packages to `rupi` with little friction.

### 46.2 Minimalism

A new user can run the harness without learning a framework.

### 46.3 Responsiveness

The tool feels immediate at startup and during ordinary interaction.

Optional integrations do not block the editor.

### 46.4 Local-model robustness

Long-running sessions remain usable despite:

- slow prefill;
- finite context;
- local server instability;
- experimental model behavior.

### 46.5 Auditability

A user can answer:

- Which model generated this?
- What reasoning was actually exposed?
- What was reconstructed?
- Which tools had run?
- Which side effects succeeded?
- What evidence had the model seen?
- When did compaction occur?
- Did failover occur?
- Which model epoch produced this artifact?

### 46.6 Context efficiency

The active prompt can shrink without losing the canonical trace or durable evidence references.

### 46.7 Composability

An external orchestrator can operate `rupi` without scraping terminal output.

### 46.8 Visual clarity

Long sessions remain skimmable through consistent semantic highlighting rather than heavy UI chrome.

## 47. Major Risks and Mitigations

### Pi compatibility scope creep

**Risk:** Attempting complete compatibility dominates development.

**Mitigation:** Versioned compatibility matrix; focus on public ecosystem surfaces.

### Trace growth

**Risk:** Reasoning and tool output consume large disk space.

**Mitigation:** Content-addressed blobs, compression, retention policy, optional raw capture.

### Sensitive logging

**Risk:** Traces preserve secrets.

**Mitigation:** Redaction-first storage, restrictive permissions, opt-in raw payloads.

### Incorrect reconstructed rationale

**Risk:** Inference sounds authoritative.

**Mitigation:** Strong provenance labels and separate visual treatment.

### Compaction loss

**Risk:** Important state disappears from active context.

**Mitigation:** Structured capsules, checkpoints, trace preservation, optional validation.

### Backup incompatibility

**Risk:** Backup lacks context size, tools, or modality.

**Mitigation:** Capability gate and context rebudgeting before takeover.

### MCP complexity

**Risk:** Interoperability expands core complexity.

**Mitigation:** Isolate behind adapters; lazy loading; support tested subsets first.

### Startup regression

**Risk:** Features gradually make the harness feel heavy.

**Mitigation:** Startup latency budgets, lazy initialization, dependency scrutiny, performance CI.

### TUI overdesign

**Risk:** "Modern" becomes visually noisy.

**Mitigation:** Semantic styling only; restrained chrome; collapse detail by default.

## 48. Foundational Invariants

Unless explicitly revised, the following should be treated as architectural rules:

1. The execution trace is distinct from model context.
2. Compaction never silently destroys canonical execution history.
3. Reasoning provenance is always explicit.
4. Hidden chain-of-thought is never claimed to have been recovered when it was not exposed.
5. Only one model is active in a normal execution role at a time.
6. Backup-model activation is fault recovery, not orchestration.
7. Potentially destructive tools are never blindly replayed across uncertain failure boundaries.
8. External evidence retains durable source attribution.
9. MCP is an interoperability boundary, not the internal agent architecture.
10. Pi compatibility is measured and versioned.
11. Domain-specific capabilities remain outside the core.
12. The default user experience requires little configuration.
13. Optional capability initialization must not block the editor from becoming usable.
14. Context should be optimized for useful information per unit inference cost, not maximal fill.
15. Visual design should encode semantics rather than decoration.
16. Rare and consequential runtime events should be prominent; routine execution should remain quiet.
17. Startup-path work and dependencies require stronger justification than lazy/on-demand work.
18. Session state belongs to the runtime, not to any particular model.

## 49. Design Mantras

### Product

> **Minimal core. Compatible ecosystem. Observable execution. Honest provenance. Recoverable state.**

### Context

> **Context is a cache, not the record.**

### External knowledge

> **Evidence should be attributable and rehydratable.**

### UX

> **Quiet by default. Rich when inspected. Semantic rather than decorative.**

### Performance

> **Instant before complete.**

### Engineering

> **Eager only for the critical path; lazy everywhere else.**

### Scope

> **If it defines how work is performed, it probably belongs outside the runtime. If it makes execution fundamentally more reliable, inspectable, compatible, or composable, it may belong inside.**

## 50. Long-Term Vision

A mature `rupi` session may look like:

```text
User
 |
 v
rupi
 |
 +-- Qwen local model
 |      |
 |      +-- exposed native reasoning
 |      +-- coding tools
 |      +-- RKB retrieval
 |      +-- MCP resources
 |
 +-- context reaches performance boundary
 |      |
 |      `-- semantic compaction
 |
 +-- local inference server crashes
 |      |
 |      `-- backup model takes over
 |
 +-- execution continues
 |
 +-- PR merged
 |      |
 |      `-- checkpoint/reset
 |
 `-- compact semantic state returned to user/orchestrator
```

Meanwhile the durable record preserves:

```text
user requests
model epochs
native reasoning that was exposed
provider summaries
declared rationales
reconstructed rationales
tool calls
tool results
external evidence
source provenance
context changes
compactions
checkpoints
failovers
final artifacts
```

The active model may have forgotten most of the intermediate detail.

The runtime has not.

That leads to the central architectural idea:

> **Working memory is disposable, evidence is rehydratable, execution is traceable, and the model itself is replaceable.**

`rupi` should remain a minimal coding harness at the surface while providing a more explicit, reliable runtime underneath.

That distinction should guide every major design decision.
