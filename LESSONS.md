# LESSONS

Durable, verified lessons for contributors to this repository. Keep entries small and
evidence-backed; delete one when its prevention becomes structurally enforced.

## Select Git Bash explicitly for native Windows startup checks

PowerShell can resolve `bash` to the WSL launcher while Rust is installed for Windows.
The startup script then fails with `cargo: command not found` despite native Cargo working.
Check `Get-Command bash,cargo,python`, then invoke Git for Windows Bash explicitly:

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles/Git/bin/bash.exe" bench/startup.sh --json bench/results/startup-ci.json
```

Use an installed Rust toolchain matching the repository pin. The script already chooses
native `python` under Git Bash, avoiding broken Windows `python3` execution aliases.
The explicit shell route passed the required benchmark after the WSL route failed;
no benchmark or runtime change was needed.

## Merging a stacked PR series out of band leaves every PR "open"

- Context: 36 CI-green PRs, each stacked on another branch, all landed into `main`
  with local `git merge --no-ff` commits pushed in one go.
- Symptom: `gh pr list --state open` still shows all 36 after the push, and
  `gh pr diff N` keeps reporting a file diff, even though every head commit is in
  `main`.
- Cause: GitHub marks a PR merged only when the merge lands through its own merge
  path (or a matching merge commit lands per-push); a batch push of pre-made merge
  commits does not close them. `gh pr diff` is computed base...head, not "is the
  head reachable from base".
- Resolution: verify containment with
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor "$(gh pr view N --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)" main`,
  then `gh pr close N --comment "superseded by integration merge <sha>"`.
- Prevention: for a batch integration, script the ancestor check + close as part of
  the merge loop, right after pushing `main`.

## Resolve a many-branch merge in topological order, and take "both" for append-only lists

- Context: the same files (`ROADMAP.md` checkbox lists, `src/cli.rs` help tables and
  flag lists, `src/main.rs` dispatch arms) were edited by nearly every branch.
- Symptom: the same 3-way conflict shape repeated on every merge; a wrong
  "ours/theirs" choice silently deleted another branch's line (a lost `interactive`
  help row failed `tests/interactive_cli.rs` late).
- Cause: these files are append-only lists; whole-file ours/theirs choices drop the
  other side's entries.
- Resolution: merge leaves-first in stack order; for these files resolve hunk-wise
  taking both sides (prefer `[x]` on checkbox state, keep the evolved help format,
  union flag lists and dispatch arms), then run `cargo check --workspace
  --all-targets` after every few merges instead of only at the end.
- Prevention: when a conflict is "two lines added at the same slot", the answer is a
  union, not a choice; the compile after each merge catches signature evolution
  (e.g. `open_session` gaining a `resume` parameter, `after_turn` returning
  `TurnReport`) while the cause is still obvious.

## Never start a mass merge with uncommitted plan documents in the tree

- Context: `ROADMAP.md` carried an uncommitted "next best steps" section when a
  36-PR integration began.
- Symptom: mid-merge `git checkout --theirs ROADMAP.md` (the standard resolution for
  a parallel rewrite of that file) silently discarded the uncommitted section; it
  existed in no commit, no branch, and was unrecoverable.
- Cause: checkout-based conflict resolution overwrites the worktree copy; anything
  uncommitted in that file is gone, and merges do not warn about it.
- Resolution: reconstructed the section from the merged state and marked it as
  reconstructed in the file itself.
- Prevention: commit or stash plan/status docs before the first merge commit of any
  batch; `git status` must be clean for files a merge is expected to touch.

## Help-surface compatibility tests pin the exact top-level help shape

- Context: the top-level help moved from `rupi <cmd> [options]` usage lines to a
  `Commands:` table; a test asserted `contains("rupi interactive")`.
- Symptom: an unrelated-looking integration failure in
  `tests/interactive_cli.rs::top_level_help_names_the_interactive_command` after a
  help-table merge resolution.
- Cause: the test pinned the old prefixed shape; help-text merges are compatibility
  changes, not cosmetic ones.
- Resolution: keep the table canonical, update the assertion to the bare command
  name with a comment saying why, and keep every command row present (the lost
  `interactive` row was itself a regression).
- Prevention: when resolving conflicts in `TOP_HELP`/`RUN_HELP`, diff the rendered
  `rupi --help` output against every `tests/*_cli.rs` assertion before committing
  the merge.

## Context probes must be pure

When a recovery path needs to measure a candidate request, do not call a builder that also
consults policy and evicts or compacts live messages. Assemble the candidate from a copied
message vector with the same production provider, system prompt, tools, and thinking settings;
only commit context changes after that candidate fits. A measurement that mutates the working
set can make the recovery boundary point at the wrong history and turn a safe retry into a
false no-op.

## Overflow fixtures must fit the recovery mechanism

A context-window fixture must be large enough to carry the bounded summary, retained current
turn, system prompt, tool schemas, and request overhead. Tiny windows can make the recovery
request structurally impossible before the behavior under test is reached. Keep a separate
no-fit test, but size the success fixtures from the mechanism's own minimum request shape.

## Provider overflow is not failover

A provider's context refusal proves that the exact request was too large; switching models is
not a substitute for compacting history. Only an uncommitted refusal may trigger one local
prefix compaction and reissue, and committed reasoning, text, or decoded tool calls must make
the refusal terminal.

## Check the status of the command that actually ran

An in-process PowerShell script can succeed while LASTEXITCODE retains an earlier native
failure. Use terminating errors and check `$?` immediately after script or cmdlet calls;
check `$LASTEXITCODE` explicitly after native programs, including `pwsh -File`. A stale
native status incorrectly rejected a successful synthetic template probe. Immediate script
status checks verified two ordered-fixture invocations with identical output. Keep these
checks next to the command, before another operation replaces its status.

## A writable Windows path may still be an invalid child working directory

The completion host could create/copy a long run-derived snapshot, while Process.Start
rejected its working directory before public checks ran. An owned short-path missing-file
fixture returned Failed; the same long-path fixture threw "directory name is invalid".
Select a short independent scratch root for snapshots/command artifacts while retaining
the run-local mailbox and all evidence. Both roots must remain outside the canonical
workspace. `bench/test-completion-feedback.ps1` reproduces the Windows baseline and checks
short-root missing-deliverable failure, fresh repair success and canonical effect isolation.
Keep observation Unavailable distinct from known failed checks; do not replay an uncertain
check to hide a path-layout failure.
