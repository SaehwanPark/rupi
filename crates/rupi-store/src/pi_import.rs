//! Reading a Pi session file.
//!
//! This module turns one Pi JSONL session into the material a rupi session is made of.
//! It is a *prototype* in a specific sense: it imports what Pi's format states, and reports
//! what it cannot carry rather than inventing a plausible substitute. That bias is the
//! whole design. Pi records more than rupi models -- branch trees, extension entries,
//! labels, thinking levels, per-request costs -- and an importer that quietly mapped those
//! onto the nearest-looking rupi event would produce a session that looks native and
//! isn't. The rule used here:
//!
//! - A Pi fact with a rupi equivalent becomes that event.
//! - A Pi fact with no rupi equivalent becomes a report line naming the entry type and
//!   the reason.
//! - A rupi field that Pi does not record gets the conservative value, never a friendly
//!   one, and the report says so once.
//!
//! Two invariants keep the result honest:
//!
//! - **An import never executes anything.** Pi's file is a record of tool calls that
//!   already happened elsewhere. They are imported as records; no call is replayed, and
//!   imported calls are marked as *not* read-only because that is the direction in which a
//!   mistake is safe.
//! - **An import never pretends to be native.** The header records `imported_from`, and the
//!   model that owned epoch 0 is the one Pi's own entries name, or an explicit `unknown`
//!   rather than a guess.
//!
//! Parsing is deliberately untyped over [`serde_json::Value`]. Pi's format has more entry
//! and message roles than any Rust enum here could keep up with, and forward compatibility
//! is worth more than a compile-time guarantee that would be satisfied by ignoring the
//! future. Unknown shapes are reported, not rejected: a session that also contains an
//! entry type this file has never seen still imports.
