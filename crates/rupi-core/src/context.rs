//! Context lifecycle contracts.
//!
//! Canonical rule: **context is a cache, not the record.** The context engine
//! may shrink what the model sees, but it may never become the place where
//! history is kept, and it may never claim that a reduction lost information
//! that is still recoverable from the trace.
//!
//! Policy lives here as data. Mechanism (rewriting messages, archiving
//! payloads, writing capsules) lives in the context engine and store. The
//! ladder is:
//!
//! - [`ContextLevel::L0Payload`] — reduce an oversized payload to a bounded
//!   representation with a recovery reference.
//! - [`ContextLevel::L1Ordinary`] — ordinary compaction of older turns.
//! - [`ContextLevel::L2Phase`] — semantic phase compaction at a declared
//!   boundary, only at safe idle points, behind a cooldown.
//! - [`ContextLevel::L3Checkpoint`] — episode capsule plus reviewed reset.
//!
//! Thresholds shrink for constrained windows and deliberately do **not** grow
//! for large advertised windows: a provider offering a huge window has not
//! claimed that a huge working context is desirable.
//!
//! ### Checkpoint Barrier and Compaction Policy Interplay
//!
//! An L3 Episode Checkpoint produces a durable structured [`ContextCapsule`] and
//! establishes a [`crate::session::SessionRecord::CheckpointBarrier`] in the session log.
//! When a checkpoint is created:
//! 1. **History Sealed**: All conversation events prior to the barrier are sealed into
//!    the archive and trace journal. They are never modified or re-summarized.
//! 2. **Working Set Reset**: The model-visible working context is reset to the structured
//!    capsule representation ([`ContextCapsule::format_for_model`]) plus any post-barrier
//!    retained tail.
//! 3. **Pressure Relieved**: Active token count drops from the pre-checkpoint level
//!    (exceeding `checkpoint_tokens`) back to the compact footprint of the capsule
//!    (~300-800 tokens), relieving both L1 and L3 pressure thresholds.
//! 4. **Epoch Incremented & Cooldown Armed**: The compaction epoch increments, and the L3
//!    compaction cooldown timer resets, preventing checkpoint thrashing.
//! 5. **Subsequent L1 Compactions Bounded**: Subsequent L1 ordinary compactions operate
//!    strictly on the post-checkpoint epoch.
//! 6. **Bounded Resume**: On session resume, the store loads only the latest
//!    capsule and post-checkpoint events, keeping resume latency bounded regardless of
//!    lifetime session length.
//!
