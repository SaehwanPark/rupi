//! Typed runtime events.
//!
//! The event stream is the single source of truth shared by the durable trace,
//! the session journal, the UI, replay, failover continuity, and diagnostics.
//! There is deliberately no second, ad hoc logging path for the same facts.
//!
//! Global rules:
//!
//! - **Identity.** Every event carries [`EventMeta`]. Identity fields are
//!   optional only where the fact does not exist yet (for example
//!   `model_epoch` before the first epoch exists).
//! - **Ordering.** Within one session, ordering is defined by [`EventSeq`],
//!   assigned by the durable event log at append time. Timestamps are for
//!   humans and timelines; they never define order, because clocks step.
//! - **Causality.** `parent_event_id` points at the causal predecessor
//!   (for example a tool completion points at its model request), and
//!   `trace_id`/`span_id` group one causal execution.
//! - **Persistence.** Every event here is journal-worthy by default. Events
//!   that are high-volume by nature (deltas) are journaled in the trace and
//!   may be coalesced or blob-reduced by the store; they are never routed to a
//!   separate channel.
//! - **Replay.** Replaying an event stream must reproduce the same visible
//!   state, including model attribution and reasoning provenance, without
//!   re-executing anything. Events are facts about the past; they never carry
//!   instructions.
//! - **UI relevance.** Rendering is derived from these events only. The UI
//!   does not own runtime state and does not receive facts that events do not
//!   carry.
