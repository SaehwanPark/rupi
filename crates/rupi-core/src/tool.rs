//! Tool lifecycle contract.
//!
//! Every tool invocation has a durable id and a durable lifecycle state. That

//! "may this side effect run again?" after a crash, a stream interruption, or a

//!
//! [`ToolExecutionState::Unknown`] is a terminal state in its own right. It is
//! never coerced into success or failure, and a mutating call in `Unknown` is
//! never blindly replayed.
