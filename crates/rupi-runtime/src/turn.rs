//! The turn loop: one user input, driven to a terminal state.
//!
//! A turn is the unit the user experiences and the unit the trace must
//! reconstruct. This module owns the sequence and nothing else — no wire format,
//! no side effects, no rendering. Those live behind the traits below, which is
//! what lets the same loop run against a real provider, a scripted one in a
//! test, or no provider at all.
//!
//! The invariants it defends:
//!
//! - **One model at a time.** Exactly one epoch is active; a change of model is an
//!   epoch transition with a recorded reason, never an implicit swap.
//! - Ordinary request retries require that nothing was streamed. The one bounded
//!   output-limit recovery is allowed only when no assistant output escaped to an
//!   irreversible live surface; failed deltas stay out of future model context and
//!   tools from the incomplete response never execute.
//! - **Every tool call reaches a terminal lifecycle state**, including calls that
//!   were interrupted or refused. A tool call with no terminal event is a bug here.
//! - **Context is never silently truncated.** An oversized request is refused, and
//!   the refusal is recorded.
