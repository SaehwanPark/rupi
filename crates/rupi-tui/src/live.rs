//! The live surface: a streaming transcript with two destinations.
//!
//! The split is the contract the one-shot command already promised:
//!
//! ```text
//! assistant prose  → stdout   (raw: unwrapped, undecorated, byte-faithful)
//! everything else  → stderr   (labelled, wrapped, optionally coloured)
//! ```
//!
//! Assistant text is *not* decorated even when colour is on. Piping an answer
//! `> out.md` must produce the answer, and a renderer that wraps stdout to the
//! current terminal width produces different bytes on a phone than on a
//! workstation, which makes the same command non-portable for no user benefit.
//!
//! Reasoning is the opposite case: it must always be labelled, so a live block
//! buffers until it can emit a labelled line. That buffering is bounded by the
//! column budget, never by "until the model stops talking".
