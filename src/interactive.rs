//! `rupi interactive`: one durable session, many turns, one terminal.
//!
//! The buffer ([`rupi_tui::editor`]), the keymap ([`rupi_tui::keys`]), and the
//! transcript renderer already exist. What they deliberately do not contain is the
//! loop: reading keys, owning raw mode, and deciding whether a keystroke means
//! "leave" are composition and terminal plumbing, and a crate that renders events
//! must not be the one that decides what a key means. That is why this module lives
//! in the composition root and pulls the runtime in through [`crate::run`].
//!
//! # One screen
//!
//! ```text
//! > what the user is typing           <- Editor::display(PROMPT_PREFIX)
//!   and its continuation rows
//! openai/gpt-5 · idle · enter submits, ctrl-c quits   <- one status line
//! ```
//!
//! There is no alternate screen. A turn's answer and transcript are ordinary writes
//! to stdout and stderr, and they belong in the terminal's scrollback the way any
//! other program's output does; a frame that kept its ordering intact would have to
//! own the whole screen and take the runtime's output with it. So the frame is
//! drawn, erased before each turn, and redrawn underneath whatever the turn printed.
//!
//! # Redraw discipline
//!
//! A frame is written only when something visible changed: the buffer changed, the
//! terminal was resized, or a turn ended. [`Outcome::Unchanged`] and an unmapped key
//! draw nothing, which is what keeps a held-down key from repainting the screen.
//!
//! # Why raw mode is suspended for a turn
//!
//! `crossterm::terminal::enable_raw_mode` is `cfmakeraw`, which clears `OPOST` and
//! `ONLCR`: a `\n` stops carrying the column reset with it. This module writes its
//! own `\r\n`, but a turn's output is written by the runtime through plain writers
//! that do not know they are attached to a raw terminal, and would render as a
//! staircase. Raw mode is therefore handed back for the duration of a turn. The
//! side effect is honest and documented: inside a turn, Ctrl-C is the terminal's own
//! signal rather than a key this loop reads.
//!
//! # Interrupting a turn
//!
//! What `Ctrl-C` means is decided by [`interrupt_action`], in a function that has
//! never seen a terminal and holds only the two facts that matter: whether a turn is
//! in flight, and whether anything is typed. The loop owns one [`CancelToken`] for
//! the session and starts every turn with it, so a decision to cancel is one store
//! away from the runtime, and the session and the buffer outlive the turn that was
//! stopped.
//!
//! While a turn runs, raw mode is temporarily suspended so runtime output translates
//! newlines cleanly. During that window, an in-flight `Ctrl-C` is delivered as `SIGINT`.
//! [`interrupt::TurnInterruptGuard`] installs a signal handler that atomically flags
//! the session's [`CancelToken`], cleanly interrupting model streaming or tool execution
//! without destroying the process or corrupting the session.
